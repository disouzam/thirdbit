  <em>
    This paper presents Apex, a system that can automatically generate
    explanations for programming assignment bugs, regarding where the
    bugs are and how the root causes led to the runtime failures. It
    works by comparing the passing execution of a correct
    implementation (provided by the instructor) and the failing
    execution of the buggy implementation (submitted by the
    student). The technique overcomes a number of technical challenges
    caused by syntactic and semantic differences of the two
    implementations. It collects the symbolic traces of the executions
    and matches assignment statements in the two execution traces by
    reasoning about symbolic equivalence. It then matches predicates
    by aligning the control dependences of the matched assignment
    statements, avoiding direct matching of path conditions which are
    usually quite different. Our evaluation shows that Apex is every
    effective for 205 buggy real world student submissions of 4
    programming assignments, and a set of 15 programming assignment
    type of buggy programs collected from stackoverflow.com, precisely
    pinpointing the root causes and capturing the causality for 94.5%
    of them. The evaluation on a standard benchmark set with over 700
    student bugs shows similar results. A user study in the classroom
    shows that Apex has substantially improved student productivity.

  In this paper,
  the authors combine several sophisticated techniques
  to diagnose the root causes of errors in novice programming assignments
  <em>even when the novice's code is significantly different from
  the correct implementation provided by the instructor</em>.
  They do this by collecting traces of the programs' execution
  and reasoning about them symbolically
  to figure out why the final states of variables differ,
  regardless of the paths taken to create those variables.

  This may seem like magic,
  but the methods used are well established.
  What they <em>aren't</em> is part of the usual undergraduate curriculum.
  I suspect this is due to the mathematical sophistication they require,
  but in truth,
  there is nothing here more complicated than the partial differential equations
  commonly taught in the junior or senior year of most engineering programs.

  What really made this paper for me,
  though,
  was that the authors didn't stop once they had built a complex tool:
  they assessed its real-world utility by examining some programs found on the web,
  and then did a small controlled experiment
  to see whether the feedback provided by the tool
  helped novice programmers finish assignments faster.
  All together,
  this is a wonderful exemplar of how theory can guide the implementation of new things,
  which can then be assessed empiricallyâ€“in short,
  of how engineering ought to be done.
