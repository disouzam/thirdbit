  We decided in 2012 that
  we would only review material that is openly available.
  I was therefore pleased to discover earlier this week that I could actually download papers from this year's
  International Computing Education Research conference from the ACM's site.
</p>
<p>
  …until I read that "<a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial/status/774073549002674176">#ICER2016 papers are open access <em>for next two weeks</em></a>"
  (emphasis added).
  If that's true,
  it's a real shame:
  a lot of very cool things are being presented at ICER
  that deserve to be more widely known,
  but there's no point posting links that are going to 403
  by the time most people outside the Great Paywall of Academia get around to clicking on them.
