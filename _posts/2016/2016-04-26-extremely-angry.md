  From <a href="https://twitter.com/mhoye/status/725010388547330048">this thread</a> by Mike Hoye,
  the Engineering Community Manager for Firefox at Mozilla:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extremely angry with the state of academic CS research right now.</li>
  <li>We've got a bunch of research papers that have come out of Mozilla's willingness to share a lot of our data. Bugzilla, lots of other stuff.</li>
  <li>We pay attention to that research. We read it carefully, and our operational decision-making is informed by those results.</li>
  <li>But we live and work in an evolving world, so the other thing we do as a matter of course is re-check our data to confirm our assumptions.</li>
  <li>What I <em>want</em> to be able to do is to go back and say, we based this decision in part on the results of paper X. Is that result still valid?</li>
  <li>In a sane world, that's 3 steps.
    <ul>
      <li>Clone the author's VCS</li>
      <li>Run author's [whatever] against an up-to-date dataset.</li>
      <li>Look at the new graph.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does the data still support the thesis? Great! Full steam ahead! Has something changed? Pause and think! Either way we're winning.</li>
  <li>But that never happens. Because CS researchers don't publish code or data. They publish LaTeX-templated Word docs as paywalled PDFs.</li>
  <li>And if you care about sciency stuff like "validity" or "reproducibility", even simpleton stuff like "real-world relevance", well, f*** you.</li>
  <li>Let's talk about how far behind schedule we are because people don't share what they know, or didn't make what we learned accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All of which makes me ask yet again:
  what will it take for researchers publishing in closed-access venues to realize
  how much damage they're doing to themselves by shutting out people like Mike?

    Later: coincidentally,
    the <a href="http://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> has just launched.
    Like the <a href="http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/">Journal of Open Research Software</a>,
    its mission is to give people a place and a way to get academic credit for the tools they build.
    It would be great to see some software engineering research work appearing in both...
