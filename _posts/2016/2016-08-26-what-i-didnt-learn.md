title: "What I Didn't Learn in a CS Degree"

  I recently stumbled across
  <em><a href="https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/">The Imposter's Handbook</a></em>,
  which describes itself this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    For the longest time I would remain silent when discussions with
    my peers would veer toward theoretical topics like P vs. NP,
    Lambda Calculus or bubble sort vs. merge sort...  I decided to
    change all of this a year ago. I sat down and looked up all of the
    topics that a typical CS degree covers and then I dove in. Half
    way through, I decided to write a book about what I was learning.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's an interesting project,
  but it got me thinking about all the things I <em>didn't</em> learn
  when I <em>did</em> do a CS degree:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    At 25,
    I would have said that I got where I was through hard work.
    At 53,
    I realize that most of where I am is due to being born white and male
    without serious mental or physical challenges
    in a stable middle-class family
    living in a peaceful democracy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The computing industry is actively unwelcoming to people who aren't straight white/Asian males,
    routinely builds systems that facilitate their harassment and abuse,
    and then <a href="https://twitter.com/mhoye/status/763955787869753344">pretends that the problem is somehow insoluble</a>.
    Equally,
    the financial-industrial complex called Silicon Valley doesn't actually want to disrupt anything that matters
    because it's quite happy with wealth and power being distributed as they are
    (i.e., unequally, but in their favor).
  </li>
  <li>
    To aid that,
    Silicon Valley perpetuates a mythos of rags-to-riches startups
    that enables it to extract as much unpaid or low-paid labor from people as it can,
    regardless of <a href="{{'/2015/11/09/daddy-why-dont-you-ever-laugh.html' | relative_url}}">the personal cost</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Like most technologists,
    the founders of most "learn to code" groups unconsciously assume that knowledge
    should flow one way and gratitude another:
    <em>we</em> will teach <em>them</em> Javascript and data analysis,
    and <em>they</em> will just listen.
    The fact is,
    <em>they</em> have vitally important things to teach <em>us</em>
    about running meetings, being inclusive, staying focused on things that actually matter,
    staying healthy,
    and all the other tremendously hard skills techies condescendingly called "soft".
  </li>
  <li>
    And a long list of other insights that still often make me uncomfortable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It's easy to say "this stuff isn't part of computer science",
  but that's disingenuous.
  The boundaries of computer science can be exactly where we choose to draw them,
  just like the boundaries of medicine or economics.
  Right now,
  those boundaries are drawn by the privileged in ways that implicitly enshrine their privilege,
  but they could include this:
</p>
  <a href="{{'/files/2016/08/women-in-cs.jpg' | relative_url}}"><img src="{{'/files/2016/08/women-in-cs.jpg' | relative_url}}" alt="Declining Female Participation in Computing" width="400px" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  or the fact that "Massive Open Online Course" has effectively come to mean
  <a href="{{'/2014/03/14/learning-at-scale.html' | relative_url}}">ubiquitous surveillance in the classroom</a>,
  or anything else if we so choose.
</p>
<p>
  The first step toward choosing is to be aware that there are choices.
  That's why I'm looking forward to <em>The Imposter's Handbook</em>,
  but would look forward more to a book
  that collected and presented all the "other stuff" I didn't learn in school.
  I'm not qualified to write it,
  but nothing would make me prouder than to see it as
  the next volume in the <a href="http://aosabook.org/">AOSA</a> series.
  I'd be grateful for your thoughts.
