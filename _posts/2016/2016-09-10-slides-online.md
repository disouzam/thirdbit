<p>
  I've posted HTML slides for two upcoming talks,
  one on <a href="{{'/lessons-learned/' | relative_url}}">lessons learned from Software Carpentry</a>,
  the other on <a href="{{'/not-on-the-shelves/' | relative_url}}">what's missing in computing</a>
  and what it can tell us about our field.
  I'll be giving one or both at York University, the University of Illinois, the University of Michigan,
  and the University of Wisconsin this fall â€“
  hope to see you there.
