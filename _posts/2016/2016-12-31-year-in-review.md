    <p>
      We got back from England almost exactly a year ago.
      It took us six months to find a house and another three to do renovations,
      but we moved in mid-October
      and are just wrapping up a wonderful Christmas with family and friends.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      My mum moved out of the house I grew up in April,
      48 years after moving in,
      and we gave away the last of my dad's books.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/12/14/next-steps.html">resigned</a>
      from my position as Director of Instructor Training for <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>.
      I start <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/education">my new position with Shopify</a> in February 2017.
      I did this in part because
      Software Carpentry's <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training course</a>
      is finally in reusable form,
      and 15 people are now qualified to teach it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I finally wrote down <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/10/19/given-infinite-minions.html">all the projects I'll never have time to do</a>
      and put together <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/09/21/reading-list.html">a reading list</a>
      that I wish I could send back in time to my twenty-something self.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Thinking about this,
      about <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/08/26/what-i-didnt-learn.html">what I didn't learn in my CS degree</a>,
      and about all of the political catastrophes of 2016
      spurred me to kick off <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2016/11/13/stuff-that-actually-matters.html">a book about stuff that actually matters</a>.
      We're also going to try to organize another <a href="http://t3summit.org/">Teaching Tech Together</a> summit,
      and a couple of other things are brewing as well.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I tore my rotator cuff in a fall in January,
      which left me unable to exercise for most of the year.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I read a few good books,
      including Jahren's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lab-Girl-Hope-Jahren/dp/1101874937/"><em>Lab Girl</em></a>,
      Brown's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/"><em>Building Powerful Community Organizations</em></a>,
      and Jemisin's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296/"><em>The Fifth Season</em></a>.
      I also played a few good games:
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Raven-Games-RED001-Eight-Minute/dp/B00CQ6P84E/"><em>Eight-Minute Empire</em></a>
      and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fireside-Games-FSD1001-Castle-Panic/dp/B002IUFSPM/"><em>Castle Panic</em></a>
      were the most fun,
      but there was a whole lot of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-42003-Uno-Card-Game/dp/B00004TZY8/"><em>Uno</em></a>
      going on in this house as well,
      and my daughter now knows not to draw to an inside straight when playing poker.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I made progress on <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/cloudherd-tigers-boy/">the book I'm writing for my daughter</a>,
      but didn't finish it in time for Christmas.
      I didn't finish rewriting <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/beneath-coriandel/">this one</a>
      or <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/madica/">this one</a>,
      but I <em>did</em> run a writing class at my daughter's school,
      which was a lot of fun.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I didn't <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2015/11/09/daddy-why-dont-you-ever-laugh.html">crash</a> this year.
      Instead,
      I got <a href="{{site.github.url}}/cthulhu.mp3">a new ringtone</a> that seems more in keeping with the spirit of the times.
    </p>
