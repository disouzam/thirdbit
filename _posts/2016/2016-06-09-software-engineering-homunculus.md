  A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus">cortical homunculus</a></em>
  is a graphical representation showing how much of the brain is devoted to different parts of the body:
</p>
<table cellpadding="10px">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="{{ '/files/2016/06/homunculus-brain.png' | relative_url }}" width="300px" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{ '/files/2016/06/homunculus-front.png' | relative_url }}" width="300px" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  It would be fascinating to see a similar diagram showing how much
  software engineering research effort is devoted to which parts of
  the things software developers actually do.
  I strongly suspect,
  for example,
  that the ratio of research to practice is much greater than unity for software product families,
  while there is much (much) less research into installation and package management
  than there is practical wrangling.
  If someone has a grad student looking for a project,
  I'd be happy to chatâ€¦
