<p>
  I noted earlier this week that the ACM was making papers from this year's
  <a href="https://icer.hosting.acm.org/">International Computing Education Research</a> conference
  freely available&mdash;but only for two weeks,
  which isn't what anyone else means by "open access"
  (and is frankly ridiculous).
  I'm therefore grateful to <a href="http://twistedsquare.com/">Neil Brown</a> for pointing out
  bullet #4 on <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Retained">this page</a>,
  which says that authors and owners permanently hold the right to:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Post the Accepted Version of the Work on (1) the Author's home
    page, (2) the Owner's institutional repository, (3) any repository
    legally mandated by an agency funding the research on which the
    Work is based, and (4) any non-commercial repository or
    aggregation that does not duplicate ACM tables of contents, i.e.,
    whose patterns of links do not substantially duplicate an
    ACM-copyrighted volume or issue. Non-commercial repositories are
    here understood as repositories owned by non-profit organizations
    that do not charge a fee for accessing deposited articles and that
    do not sell advertising or otherwise profit from serving articles.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In other words, people can now post open-access copies of their
  papers as long as they do so on non-commercial sites.  It's clear
  that this isn't widely known, so I'll be mailing some of the
  researchers who presented at ICER (and elsewhere) asking them to
  take advantage of it, and will post reviews here as papers become
  available.
