[Harriet Alexander just announced](https://twitter.com/nekton4plankton/status/960295582224011264)
that she has taught
[the first Software Carpentry workshop in Antarctica](https://halexand.github.io/2018-02-03-swc-antarctica/).
Coincidentally,
[registration is now open](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carpentrycon-2018-tickets-42447719271)
for [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/);
it'll be much easier to get to than McMurdo Sound,
so I hope to see you there.
