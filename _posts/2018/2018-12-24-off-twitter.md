After yet another unpleasant encounter on Twitter,
I have deliberately locked myself out of my account for a couple of weeks:
it just doesn't seem the grief any more.
If you'd like to chat,
I've re-enabled comments on this blog,
and can always be reached [by email](mailto:{{site.author.email}}).

Happy Hogswatchnight, one and all.
