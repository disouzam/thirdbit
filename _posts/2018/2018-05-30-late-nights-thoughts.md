    <p>
      Presented at CarpentryCon 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost didn't come to this conference.
      When the invitation arrived, I looked at it and thought, "What the hell do I have left to say?"
      You've all heard both of my jokes,
      and many of you tell my stories better than I do---or at least, more factually.
      I could talk about the history of Software Carpentry,
      and how we got to where we are today...

      ...but most of you don't have a high enough security clearance for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      After rambling and ranting and arguing and teaching to you and with you for so many years,
      I felt like I had nothing left,
      so I wrote an apologetic email,
      deleted it,
      wrote another,
      deleted that,
      and then said "yes",
      picked a title more or less at random,
      and waited for inspiration to strike.

    <p>
      For every beginning there has to be an ending,
      but we don't talk about endings much.
      There are thousands of books on Amazon about how to start a business;
      there's only a handful about how to hand one on,
      and even fewer about how to leave one gracefully.
      Sooner or later,
      you will wind up the project you're working on
      or leave your job
      or maybe get out of academia altogether to do something else,
      and that's what I'd like to start with today.

    <p>
      People who start things usually aren't good with idleness,
      and idleness tends not to be good for them,
      so when you leave,
      leave for something,
      even if it's something small.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't do any of these things as well as I should have when I left Software Carpentry,
      but this last one is the one I've been kicking myself for the most.
      The reason I got it wrong is that I fell back into some bad old patterns of thought.
      You see,
      academia doesn't care if something is useful---it cares if something is <em>new</em>.
      Like a lot of you,
      I internalized that in grad school without ever really questioning it.
      It's been years since I thought of myself as an academic,
      but I still often feel kind of embarrassed doing something that's been done before.
      I keep thinking I have to innovate.

      The truth is, I never really have.
      I joke sometimes that I'm a thought scavenger, not a thought leader,
      but it's not really a joke.
      Some of the tools I teach are almost as old as me,
      and compared to some of you,
      I'm as old as dirt.
      The teaching practices that we use aren't new either---I mean,
      live coding is just teaching by demonstration,
      and cats do that with their kittens.
      And yeah,
      I do occasionally pick up something new...

    <p>
      Which brings us to Ike Quebec.
      He was a jazz musician---tenor sax.
      He had a few hits in the 40s,
      but between a drug problem and changes in musical taste,
      he didn't record much in the 50s.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his last three years,
      though,
      he laid down some albums that I have listened to at least a couple of thousand times.
      They were one of the reasons I started playing the sax myself,
      and they are still on every single electronic device with a headphone jack that I own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike Quebec had this big, round, beautiful sound---it's like a hug from an old friend---but he wasn't an innovator.
      He never did anything melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically that other people hadn't done before,
      and because of that,
      he's not considered one of the greats.
      In jazz as in academia,
      it's not enough to do something wonderful:
      you have to do something <em>new</em>.

      I'll happily watch <em>The Mummy</em> yet again because it's a fun, dumb movie.
      And I will teach people how to break their code up into functions
      and how to organize their data into usable tables
      and how to design a multiple choice question
      because even if it isn't new to me,
      it's new to them,

      So what does playing the standards for a new audience actually look like?
      Well,
      over the past year or so,
      I've run a scaled-down one-day class on teaching based on Carpentry's instructor training
      for the staff from the Toronto Public Library,
      a couple of local companies,
      and people who volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding groups.
      The curriculum would be familiar to all of you---novice versus competent versus expert,
      seven plus or minus two,
      motivation and demotivation,
      recording yourself in groups of three...

      I'm now talking to several groups that teach people how to be safe online,

      because right now,
      to be honest,
      I think that what they're doing is more important than version control.
      I don't have to tell you that the world and the internet are a lot scarier than they were two years ago.
      Just like a few basic coding skills can make you a more productive researcher,
      a few basic security practices---the digital equivalent of washing your hands before you eat
      or using a condom or keeping your shots up to date---can help you protect yourself from stalkers and trolls.

      You might want to pursue it as well:
      you may not think you know enough to teach others,

      In short,
      if you want things to get better,
      you need to be on the right committee and in the right room
      to make your argument or cast your vote when it matters.
      Valerie talked this morning about the way that
      individual action by targets doesn't fix systemic oppression and inequality.
      If you want to do that you need to learn how to get and use power,
      because inertia is one of the fundamental forces of nature,
      and no change for the better ever happened by itself.

      I've been a pretty vocal critic of the modern university system,
      but I still think it's one of the crown jewels of human civilization.
      There are people though--more of them every day---who would tear it all down
      because silencing the messenger is easier than dealing with climate change
      or because they believe that anything that can be commoditized should be.
      We've been losing ground against them for the last few years.
      If we don't fight back---if we don't organize and collaborate
      and admit to ourselves that there are sides here and we need to pick one---then
      whether or not someone uses version control will be the least of our problems.

      If you're interested in going down this road,
      here are three papers that I've found really useful.
      I'm still learning---I hope I'll <em>always</em> be learning---so
      I may change my mind about all of this,
      but it feels right.

      I said earlier that for every beginning there has to be an ending.
      That may feel pretty gloomy for a Wednesday afternoon,
      but keep in mind that every ending except the last one is a beginning as well.
      I hope that when you look back twenty years from now,
      you'll see the Carpentries as a beginning.
      I hope you'll have taken what you learned about teaching
      and about working with other people for the greater good
      and done something wonderful with it.
      And above all,
      I hope that when it's late at night and you're listening to whoever <em>you</em> listen to
      when you realize it's time to move on,
      you'll think it was worth it.

      I do.
