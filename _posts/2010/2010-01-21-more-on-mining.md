Several people have recently linked to Diederik van Liere's talk "<a href="http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/learning-from-10-yrs-of-bugzilla-data/">Learning from 10 yrs of Bugzilla data</a>". If you're interested in that kind of thing, there's a whole sub-field in software engineering devoted to mining information about actual development practices from various sources. The best two places to start are:
<ol>
  <li>Kagdi, Collard, and Maletic: "<a href="http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/JSME07-survey.pdf">A survey and taxonomy of approaches for mining software repositories in the context of software evolution</a>". Journal of Software Maintenance, 19(2), 2007.</li>
  <li>Ahmed E. Hassan: "<a href="http://sail.cs.queensu.ca/publications/pubs/FOSM2008Hassan.pdf">The Road Ahead for Mining Software Repositories</a>". In Proc. Future of Software Maintenance, at ICSM 2008.</li>
</ol>
My thanks to <a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/">Mike Godfrey</a> for the pointers.
