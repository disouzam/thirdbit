The opening isn't promising---"more than 60 countries and international organizations have developed nearly 275 policy documents related with the use of Open Source in public sector"---but <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/EXTEDEVELOPMENT/0,,contentMDK:22407934~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:559460,00.html">the presentation itself</a> is worth a look.
