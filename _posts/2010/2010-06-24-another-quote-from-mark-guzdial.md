From "<a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/proving-and-improving-teaching-programming-languages/">Proving  and Improving Teaching Programming Languages</a>":
<blockquote><a href="http://mt4.acm.org/educationboard/">SIGPLAN Education Board</a> has produced a report "<a href="http://www.cs.pomona.edu/%7Ekim/why.pdf">Why  undergraduates should learn the principles of programming languages</a>"   which was presented at the ACM Education Council meeting.  It makes  four claims for why students should study programming languages:
<ul>
	<li>Students learn widely-applicable design and implementation  techniques.</li>
	<li>Many students will need to create new domain specific languages or  virtual machines, so it's useful for them to study what's known about  languages.</li>
	<li>By learning programming languages, students learn new computational  models and speed learning of new languages.  "The best preparation for  quickly learning and effectively using new languages is understanding  the fundamentals underlying all programming languages and to have some  prior experience with a variety of computational models."</li>
	<li>Students learn how to choose the right programming language for a  task.</li>
</ul>
The problem is that we have empirical support for none of these  claims.  People are <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6160&amp;page=39">amazingly  bad at transferring knowledge</a>.  People tend to learn about a  specific situation and not recognize when the same idea applies in a new  situation---or worse, they transfer <em>negatively</em>, mistaking the  similarity and using older knowledge in an incorrect way.</blockquote>
