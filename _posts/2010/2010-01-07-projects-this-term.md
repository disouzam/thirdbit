Along with the <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">cross-country capstone projects</a> I'm coordinating this term, I'm also setting up six projects for the students in my <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc302-2010-01">CSC302</a> software engineering course (the first four of which I mentioned in an <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3287.html">earlier post</a>):
<ol>
	<li>Adding pivot tables to Gnumeric.</li>
	<li>Upgrading PyLint.</li>
	<li>Converting the Selenium IDE to a plugin architecture.</li>
	<li>Improving the SpatiaLite GIS extensions for SQLite.</li>
	<li>Porting Django to Python 3.</li>
	<li>Helping with ILUTE (the Integrated Land Use and Transportation Engineering tool).</li>
</ol>
10-11 students will be working on each; it promises to be an exciting term.
