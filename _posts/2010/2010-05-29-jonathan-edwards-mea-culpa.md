I don't agree with <a href="http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=422">everything he says</a>, but I do agree with this:
<blockquote>...what really matters in programming...is not...solving puzzles and  being the brightest kid in the class. It is...realizing that the  complexity of software dwarfs even the most brilliant human; that  cleverness cannot win. The only weapons we have are simplicity and  convention. What is truly decisive on the  battlefield are attitudes: hard work, responsibility, and paying  attention to reality instead of the voiceover in your head.</blockquote>
