Andrew Trusty (a grad student at U of T) has just finished his Master's degree, and as part of that he built <a href="http://andrewtrusty.com/2010/04/20/learning-foreign-language-vocabulary-with-aloe/">a tool called ALOE</a> that helps people learn a foreign language by selectively translating parts of web pages into that language as they read. Neat!
