Tania Samsonova has posted an interesting article discussing <a href="http://blogidol.ca/2010/03/whats-most-important-in-enterprise-it/355">the importance of communication skills</a> to job success for junior developers. Drawing on the work of people like Andrew Begel and Beth Simon (who are contributing a chapter to our upcoming book on evidence-based software engineering), Tania talks about how the ability to ask questions and share ideas is a lot more important than specific technical skills. I particularly like this quote:

> - Anna, congratulations: your understanding of spoken English improved a lot.
>
> -How do you know? You rarely talk to me anyway.
>
> -You've stopped smiling and nodding all the time when people talk to you.
