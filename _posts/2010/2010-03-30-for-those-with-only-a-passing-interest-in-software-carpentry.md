Now that Software Carpentry Version 4 is a go, I've moved most blogging about scientific software development over to http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com. Recent highlights include:
<ol>
  <li>You can now follow Software Carpentry's progress on Twitter as @swcarpentry.</li>
  <li>I'm helping teach a course on analyzing next-generation sequencing data at Michigan State University at the end of May.</li>
  <li>Some thoughts on online course delivery.</li>
  <li>Some more thoughts on instructional design. (These two posts are mostly actually pleas for help.)</li>
  <li>The announcement that the course bibliography is online.</li>
  <li>A discussion of what's missing from that bibliography.</li>
  <li>My analysis of the pros and cons of various formats for the course material. Much to my own surprise, LaTeX is the frontrunner...</li>
</ol>
