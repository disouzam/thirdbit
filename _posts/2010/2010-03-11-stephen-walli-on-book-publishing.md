<a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2010/03/the-future-of-book-publishing-business-models.html">Interesting post</a> about the future of book publishing: it's brighter than you think, but quite different from today. And yes, I remember Sam's tooâ€¦

<em>Later: Megan Garber has described <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/03/the-boulder-way-a-bookstores-experiment-with-microdistribution/">another interesting model</a>, where authors self-publish and bookstores distribute.
