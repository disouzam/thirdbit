Matt @ Mozilla's post shows what people in the School of Webcraft course draw when asked to show <a href="http://openmatt.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/draw-how-the-internet-works/">how the Internet works</a>. Some of these are very cool.

And on a related note: if you're a (wannabe) cartoonist in the Greater Toronto Area and would like to get involved in a cool project, please give me a shout.
