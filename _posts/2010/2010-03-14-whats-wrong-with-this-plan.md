My grad student Mike Conley decided several months ago to look at code review for his master's thesis. After exploring a few ideas (including badges and achievements for reviews), he has put together <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2010/03/14/lessons-from-peerscholar-an-approach-to-teaching-code-review/">a plan that might tie several things together</a> quite neatly. He and I would both appreciate your feedback.
