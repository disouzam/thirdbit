Well, it lasted six months and a bit---after promising <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3050.html">not to fly for a year</a>, I broke down and got a plane ticket yesterday to get to Atlanta in February for <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/">PyCon 2010</a>. I could have gone by bus or train, but it's 22 hours or more each way: by comparison, a train from London to Bologna (almost exactly the same distance) is 14 hours and change, and less than half as much with a sleeper than the equivalent ticket on VIA + Amtrak.  I can't justify the carbon load of two high-altitude flights, but I can't justify two extra days away from my family either... *sigh*
