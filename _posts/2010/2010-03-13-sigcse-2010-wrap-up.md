I wanted to go to SIGCSE (the computer science education conference) this year, but breaking my self-imposed no-fly rule once made me feel guilty enough. Lots of people have been blogging about it, so I have lots of catching up to do (and <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2010/attendees/video_program.php">lots of videos</a> to watch). The theme for <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2011" target="_blank">SIGCSE 2011 <img class="icon" title="This link opens off-site" src="http://cacm.acm.org/images/icon.external-link.gif" alt="External Link" width="8" height="8" /></a>, which is being held in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas" target="_blank">Dallas, Texas, <img class="icon" title="This link opens off-site" src="http://cacm.acm.org/images/icon.external-link.gif" alt="External Link" width="8" height="8" /></a> is "Reaching Out." The symposium will focus on connecting with colleagues in other fields and developing interdisciplinary courses and research that integrate computer science and other fields. If all goes well, I hope to have something to say by then about <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>.
