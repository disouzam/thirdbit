CivSource has posted <a href="http://civsourceonline.com/2010/07/21/toronto-cio-looks-to-promote-sustainable-open-data-strategy/">an interview with David Wallace</a>, the City of Toronto's CIO, about open data. I'm really pleased to see things are still moving ahead --- wish I could have stayed involved.
