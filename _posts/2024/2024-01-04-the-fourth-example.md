In response to [yesterday's post][three-examples] about possible sequels to
the [JavaScript][sdxjs] and [Python][sdxpy] versions of *Software Design by Example*,
someone suggested a fourth option:
*Software Debugging by Example*.
Each chapter would present an application large enough to require a bit of study
(say, 100–200 lines long),
point out a bug,
and then walk through the process of fixing it
as a way to introduce techniques for fault localization,
program repair,
and so on.

I *really* wish I knew enough to write this book…
