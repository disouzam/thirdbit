It has been five years since I updated [my list of unwritten books][shelves].
A lot has happened since then:
the COVID-19 pandemic,
[my mum's death][mum],
[losing my job][angry][^1] and finding another,
and the publication of four (soon to be five) books:
[*Teaching Tech Together*][t3],
[*JavaScript for Data Science*][js4ds],
[*Research Software Engineering with Python*][rsepy],
and the [JavaScript][sdxjs] and [Python][sdxpy] versions of *Software Design by Example*.

I [mused a bit last year][directions] about
what I'd like to do with the last few years of my career.[^2]
While I have grudgingly accepted that most programmers don't read books any more,
thinking about ones I could *write* is a way for me to think about what I could *do*,
and about how I'd like to see our profession change.
I don't expect to have any more impact than [I've had in the past][influential],
but what is life without hope?

So [here's my new list][shelves];
if any of them already exist,
or if you're working on one of them right now or would be interested in collaborating,
please [reach out](mailto:{{site.author.email}}).

[^1]: Which is an odd phrase if you think about it. It's not like I misplaced my job down the back of the couchâ€¦

[^2]: I turn 62 next week, at which point I will have outlived more than half of the men in my family going back to the 1840s.
