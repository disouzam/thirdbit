A week ago I posted [my last to-don't list][to-dont];
here's what I'm working on instead:

-   A [SQL tutorial][sql-tutorial]:
    no idea when I'm going to teach it or to whom,
    but a couple of hundred people are viewing it every day.

-   A [tutorial on systems programming for data scientist][sys-tutorial]
    that seems to be morphing into a tutorial on secure computing.
    I have even less idea who this is for,
    but I'm learning some useful things as I work on it.

-   A YA novel about [a girl living in Antarctica][iffy].
    At one point it was nearly 70,000 words long (against a target of 90,000),
    but I've torn off the back half and am slowly rebuilding it.

-   A middle-school story about [all the other Santas][santas].
    It's currently 28,000 words long (against a target of 32,000),
    but I had no idea how to end it,
    so I've set it aside for now.

-   Rounding up reviewers for the Python version of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxpy],
    which should be on the shelves in a few weeks,
    and talking to a few people about doing a third volume
    using a pure functional languageâ€”stay tuned for news.

-   Teaching the occasional workshop on [how to teach][t3]
    in order to raise money for [Rainbow Railroad][rr].
    We still don't know when [the person we're sponsoring][rr-sponsor]
    will be allowed to come to Canada,
    but we're looking forward to meeting her.

-   Physiotherapy for my left wrist,
    which I've damaged permanently by typing too much on crappy laptop keyboards.
    I expect to get most function back eventually,
    but it's the end of my music-playing days:
    the only thing I could play that wouldn't trigger the problem is the trombone,
    and my wife has made it clear that's not an option.
