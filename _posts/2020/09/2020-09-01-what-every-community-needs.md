Yesterday I wrote that [every project should make its governance discoverable]({{site.github.url}}/2020/08/31/governance.html).
Here are a few other things that would help programming communities:

-   [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh/): one-line manual pages with practical examples.

-   [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/): automated drill-down explanations of commands.

-   [this vs. that](https://thisthat.dev/): short explanations of the differences between things that are frequently confused.

-   [concept maps](https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/): or other remixable illustrations of key ideas.

Please [let me know](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com) what else is on your list:
I'm always grateful for pointers.
