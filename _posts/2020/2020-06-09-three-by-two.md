For the last few years I've been asking trainee teachers to give one another feedback
on a two-by-two grid
with positive versus negative on the vertical axis
and content versus presentation on the horizontal axis.
After some recent discussions,
I'm trying out a slightly more complicated rubric:
the vertical axis stays the same,
but the horizontal has an extra category called "interaction":

<table>
<tr>
  <th style="border: 1px solid black;">Content</th>
  <th style="border: 1px solid black;">Interaction</th>
  <th style="border: 1px solid black;">Presentation</th>
  <th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black;">&nbsp;</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black;">&nbsp;</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black;">&nbsp;</td>
  <th style="border: 1px solid black;">Positive</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black;">&nbsp;</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black;">&nbsp;</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black;">&nbsp;</td>
  <th style="border: 1px solid black;">Negative</th>
</tr>
</table>

The motivation for the new category is that things like
"instructor notices learners' questions" aren't content,
but aren't really presentation either.
Adding options generally increases cognitive load,
but I hope that will be offset by making classification simpler.
It's a small thing,
but if I've learned anything about teaching over the past twenty years,
it's that better happens one small step at a time.
