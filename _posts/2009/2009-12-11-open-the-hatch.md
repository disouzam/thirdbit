I posted <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3248.html">a link to OpenHatch</a> a few days ago; Asheesh Laroia has now put up <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2009/get-involved-in-foss/">a post of his own</a> pointing out that over 100 open source projects now tag entry-level bugs to help students get involved. He'd like your help connecting to others so that <a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a> can aggregate them.
