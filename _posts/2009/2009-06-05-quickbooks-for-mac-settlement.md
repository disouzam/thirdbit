<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/u.s._canadian_quickbooks_2006_for_mac_class_action_settlements_in_process/">The future</a> is already hereâ€”it's just unevenly distributed:

"If you are a user of QuickBooks Pro 2006 for Mac or QuickBooks New User Edition 2006 for Mac...whose data or files became inaccessible or were damaged, corrupted or lost, whether temporarily or permanently, as a result of a malfunction in the software's auto-update mechanism, you may be eligible to participate in the settlement reached in Create-A-Card, et al. v. Intuit Inc., Case No. CV-07-06452 WHA, a lawsuit pending in the Northern District of California."
