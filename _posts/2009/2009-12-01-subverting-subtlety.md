<a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/11/24/spectacle_at_we.html">Excellent post</a> from Danah Boyd about a very bad experience with real-time tweeting during a talk:
<blockquote>I think that the backchannel is perfectly reasonable as a frontchannel when the speaker is trying to entertain, but when the goal is to convey something with depth, it encourages people to be impatient and frustrated, to feed on the speaker.</blockquote>
