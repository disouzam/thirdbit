The good news is that after a long hiatus, <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/7086/democamp-toronto-19">DemoCamp is back</a>: Toronto's 19th high-tech show-and-tell/meet-and-mingle will be on March 3 at the Imperial Pub. The bad news is, tickets appear to have sold out within half an hour of the <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/7086/democamp-toronto-19">announcement</a>, so the only way to get in now is to volunteer to give a demo---details are on the announcement page.  Stay tuned for more information...
