As I've mentioned earlier, the students in this fall's edition of my consulting course are going to be asked to do something with the City of Toronto's data. One really interesting idea is to hook up with the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/vine-disaster-tech-from-micros.html">Microsoft Vine</a> project, the aim of which is to keep people connected during emergencies. If you'd like to help, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">drop me a line</a>.
