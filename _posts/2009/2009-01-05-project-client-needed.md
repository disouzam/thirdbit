Almost all of this term's students now have projects, but I'm still trying to find one for a grad student who's interested in programming language semantics, program analysis, and the like. He's smart, he works hard, he has a throwback 1970s haircutâ€”if you've got something that needs someone who really cares about the formal end of programming languages (the kind of stuff that Turbak and Gifford talk about in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Concepts-Programming-Languages-Franklyn/dp/0262201755">their book</a>), then please give me a shout ASAP.
