I hate drawing diagrams.  The worst part of the two and a half years I spent working on my first book were the eight days I spent drawing the diagrams with pencil, straightedge, and eraser (lots of eraser).  But now there's <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5374890/this-is-a-photoshop-and-it-blew-my-mind">PhotoSketch</a>, which takes a hand-drawn sketch and creates a matching photo montage. Maybe technology <em>is</em> making my life better...

Or maybe I should skip a technological generation and start <a href="http://www.xtranormal.com">typing movies</a>...
