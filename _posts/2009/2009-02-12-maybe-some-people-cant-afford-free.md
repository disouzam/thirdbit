In response to comments on <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2030.html">my post about MTEST</a> that said, "People should use open source tools instead," I can only reply, "If <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2009/02/why_i_cant_affo/">some people can't afford cheap</a>, what makes you think that everyone can afford free?"  I'm a big fan of Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and everything else, but they have their costs too --- costs that scientists with deadlines often can't afford to pay.  If someone wants to give me a grant to go and measure how productive different kinds of scientists are using different combinations of open and closed source software, you know <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu">how to reach me</a>...
