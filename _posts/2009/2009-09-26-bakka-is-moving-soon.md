Congratulations to the folks at Bakka Phoenix, Canada's best SF bookstore, who have<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/bakkaphoenix/153374.html"> acquired new digs</a> just a few minutes from campus. They're not moving 'til next year, but I can already feel gravity tugging on the contents of my walletâ€¦
