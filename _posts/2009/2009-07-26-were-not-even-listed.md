I'm going to teach a bit of web programming to the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> students this week, so I went to the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis">Programmable Web</a> site to find a simple API to use in examples.  Guess what?  "Science" isn't listed as a category---the closest thing is "medical". *sigh*
