Great post on the NOVA site about <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/beta/evolution/ten-great-advances-evolution.html">recent advances in evolutionary biology</a>. Things like this are why I keep hoping to find a way to <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">teach computing to scientists</a>: it's the only way I have to thank them for all the wonders they've given the rest of us.
