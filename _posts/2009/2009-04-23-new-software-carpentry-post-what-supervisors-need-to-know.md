There's a <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2009/04/23/what-supervisors-need-to-know/">new post</a> on the Software Carpentry blog about what the people supervising computational research need to know.  Comments there would be greatly appreciated.  (Note: I'll keep posting notices here about posts there for another month or two, just to give everyone who cares a chance to update their links.)
