<a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20090609/">Nice summary</a> from Diomidis Spinellis of a workshop titled "<a href="http://csse.usc.edu/csse/event/2009/Arch-Workshop/pages/program.html">Software Architecture Challenges in the 21st Century</a>". Nice to hear Grady Booch say, "UML was never intended as a programming language. Models can be executed only in very narrow domains, mainly expressible by state charts. Those who think otherwise are fools." However, I didn't see any mention of what I believe is the biggest challenge: teaching this stuff.  I taught "CSC407: Software Architecture" four times here at the University of Toronto, then lobbied to have the course removed from the calendar on the grounds that the material simply wasn't connecting to the students.  I still think something like my oft-proposed <em>Architecture of Open Source Applications</em> book (basically, software architecture by example) might work, but then, everything you haven't actually tried <em>might</em> work.
