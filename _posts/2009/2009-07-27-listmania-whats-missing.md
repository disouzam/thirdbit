I've created an Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R1DZU56SR0YD3Y/">Listmania list</a> of the books I think are most directly related to the material in the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course. Several important topics aren't represented, including:
<ol>
  <li>Version control</li>
  <li>Automated builds</li>
  <li>Processing XML</li>
  <li>Processing binary data</li>
  <li>Web client programming</li>
  <li>Web server programming</li>
</ol>
There are good books on all of these, but the ones I know all go into too much detail, assume too much background knowledge, or are out of date.  Whta would you recommend?  What have I missed completely that ought to be there?
