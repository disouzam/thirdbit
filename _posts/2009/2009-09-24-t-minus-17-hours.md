In a little less than 17 hours, <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/students/">48 students</a> from <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/participants/">14 different universities</a> will be starting a 3-day code sprint here at the University of Toronto.  Their workrooms are locked down, their network is waiting for them, pizza has been orderedâ€”I'm psyched, and really looking forward to working with them.
