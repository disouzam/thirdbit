The students in my combined CSC494/CSC2125 consulting course are doing their end-of-term demos from 1:30-3:00 pm on Tuesday, April 14, in the Graduate Student Union at the University of Toronto.  You can now <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/showcase-2009-04.pdf">download</a> a brochure describing their projects; everyone is welcome, and we hope to see lots of you there.
