There are more professors than ever hoping to teach the open source development process to their students---but working in the open source world can be a daunting proposition. Professors themselves have only a limited amount of time to learn about open source, and are often unsure about how, exactly, to get started.

POSSE is designed for these professors. Sponsored by Red Hat, the POSSE program is a weeklong bootcamp that will immerse professors in open source projects. Participants will spend a week of intensive participation in selected open source projects, led by professors with experience in teaching open source development, in partnership with community members who have deep experience and insight. By the end of the session, participants should have a much better understanding of the workings of open source projects, and a strong network of contacts to lean on as they begin to bring students into the open source world.

Dates: July 19th-24th, 2009.  For more information, including how to apply, visit <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Professors_Open_Source_Summer_Experience ">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Professors_Open_Source_Summer_Experience</a>.
