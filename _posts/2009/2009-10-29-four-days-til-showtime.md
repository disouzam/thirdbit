The project teams in my consulting course will be demoing at the <a href="http://rocket9broadcasting.com/Webcasts/2009/11/CoT/index.php?Page=Home">Toronto Innovations Showcase</a> on Monday and Tuesday (Nov 2-3). If you can't make it down to City Hall, please tune into the <a href="http://rocket9broadcasting.com/Webcasts/2009/11/CoT/Presentations/Live/PlayerFrames.php">webcast</a>. Lots of other projects are moving aheadâ€”just a few days ago, the City of Toronto launched a <a href="http://app.toronto.ca/tmmismonitor/index.do">Meeting Monitor</a> to let people track items that are before city council. We're looking forward to seeing what else is on show.
