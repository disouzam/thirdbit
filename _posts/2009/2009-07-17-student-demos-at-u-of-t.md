On Wednesday, July 29, from 10-12 am, our <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/?p=747">summer students will be doing presentations and demos</a> of their projects in Room 1200 of the Bahen Centre at <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=40+St+George+St,+Toronto,+ON&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=43.661166,-79.396777&amp;spn=0.016299,0.036907&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A">40 St. George Street</a>. It's the day after <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/06/22/democamp-toronto-21-tuesday-july-28th/">DemoCamp</a>, which most of the students are attending, so they should be well and truly revved to show off their own stuff.  Everyone is invited---hope to see you there.
