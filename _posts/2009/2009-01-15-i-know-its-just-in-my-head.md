…but the music for <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/bubblespinner.html">BubbleSpinner</a> (a truly addictive little game) reminds me of some of the soundtrack for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld">Homeworld</a> (the best game ever, which even two lousy sequels couldn't spoil).  I played HW for the last time three years ago today; I still miss it.
