<p>OK, "big break" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc">Software Carpentry</a> course is getting hits from all over the world in the wake of the <a href="http://www.nature.com">Nature</a> article.  I need some help with page layout (some? some? I'm an engineer with a fondness for Hawaiian shirts---I need more than <em>some</em>); I would also like someone with a background in graphic design (as opposed to another self-taught engineer) to help design a style for the 94-and-counting diagrams the course needs.  Rates negotiable; if you know someone, please have them contact me.</p>
