Every time I complain about Python's muddled response to Ruby on Rails, someone pushes back by saying, "What does it matter?"  This screenshot, taken from the "what we provide" page of a web hosting company, might serve as an answer:

Yup: Ruby gets a whole column of its own, while Python is tucked into "Miscellaneous", along with OCaml.  How many new users is <em>that</em> going to attract?
