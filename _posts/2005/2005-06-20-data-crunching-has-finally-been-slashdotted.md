The title says it all: the <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/05/06/16/1930227.shtml?tid=198&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=108&amp;tid=6">review</a> on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> isn't as flattering as I'd like, but then, having pointed out the deficiencies of so many other people's books for so many years, I suppose that's just fairâ€¦
