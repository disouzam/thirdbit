Years ago, I read a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716760088">Powers of Ten</a>, which showed the structure of the physical universe from the subatomic level up to, well, everything, really, in 10X jumps.  <a href="http://www.ngmapstore.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=105&itemType=PRODUCT&RS=1&keyword=universe">This map</a> from National Geographic uses the same trick to go from our Solar System to the universe as a whole.  I'm now wondering: has anyone ever produced anything similar for computer hardware, going from transistors to VLSI to chips on a board and on up to the Internet as a whole?  It'd be cool artwork to hang on a wall...
