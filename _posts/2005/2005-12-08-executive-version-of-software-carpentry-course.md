I'll be teaching a shortened version of the Software Carpentry course at the <a href="http://www.softwareeng.org/">Institute for Advanced Studies in Software Engineering</a> in Toronto early next year.  For more information, or if you are interested in taking part, please see the <a href="http://www.softwareeng.org/">IASSE</a>'s web site.  The dates are:
<ul>
  <li>January 16-20: one lecture per day, plus practical, with a quiz on Friday.</li>
  <li>January 23-27: ditto.</li>
  <li>February 6-10: two lectures and practical per day, with a short final exam on Friday afternoon.</li>
</ul>
I've got a <em>lot</em> to do between now and then...
