I was a professor from 2007 to 2010.
My grad students had a pretty rough time:
all five of the grant proposals I made in those 40 months were turned down,
which meant I never got any of the projects I'd envisioned for them off the ground.
I've thought occasionally about going back and trying again,
but every time I bring it up,
my spouse's response is,
"Look, if you want a divorce, just say that you want a divorce."

I can't stop thinking about things I'd like to build,
though,
both for their own sake and so that we could study their use and impact.
I have put these all on [my to-don't list][to-dont-post],
but if you are minded to tackle any of them,
please give me a shout.

1. **[A lesson aggregation system][harper-lite]**.
   Instead of building yet another repository for lessons,
   let's draw inspiration from RSS
   (which I think is right up there with "view source" as an example of what the web *could* be)
   and create a way to find and aggregate lessons.

2. **A browser-based drag-and-drop tool for data analytics**.*
   The [TidyBlocks][tidyblocks-repo] project [ground to a halt][tidyblocks-post]
   due to a lack of funding and some difficult technical challenges.
   I still believe in the idea, though,
   and think that using [Node-RED] as a starting point instead of [Blockly][blockly]
   would circumvent the technical challenges,
   give non-programmers an interface they could use immediately,
   *and* be a natural successor to [Yahoo! Pipes][yahoo-pipes].

3. **A WYSIWYG computational notebook**.
   In [a better universe than ours][notebook-post]
   someone has already built a plugin for [OpenOffice][openoffice]
   that leverages the [the Jupyter messaging protocol][jupyter-protocol],
   and the 99% of our species who prefer WYSIWYG to Markdown plus YAML plus compilation
   can create the reports they want the way they want to.
   It's not too lateâ€¦

4. **[Browsercast][browsercast],**
   which would replay an HTML slideshow in sync with a voiceover.
   Tools like Wasim Lorgat's [SVG replay][svg-replay] and [Scrimba][scrimba]
   have made me more certain than ever that
   we shouldn't turn text and HTML into video streams:
   we should share them in their original form
   so that people can search them, style them, copy and paste them,
   and feed them to screenreaders and other accessibility aids.

5. **[Use case maps][use-case-maps-post]**.
   Given an SVG diagram showing the elements of your system that produce log entries,
   be they classes or microservices,
   and UUIDs to identify the descendents of initiating messages,
   this tool would draw the diagram we all eventually wind up creating by hand
   to show what happens when and where.

6. **A caravan defense game**.
   [*Kingdom Rush: Frontiers*][kingdom-rush-frontiers] is my favorite game
   of the last ten years,
   but I'm increasingly uninterested in killing monsters.
   I want a game where I build towers to *defend* the travelers
   from bandits, predators, natural disasters, swindlers, and other threats.
   It has nothing to do with software engineering,
   but I think it would be a lot of fun.
