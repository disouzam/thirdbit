The (hopefully) final version of
[*Software Design by Example: A Tool-Based Introduction with JavaScript*][sdxjs-online]
has gone to [the publisher][sdxjs-book],
and physical copies should be available by the end of the year.
I've now started on a Python version;
the topics and some key ideas are listed below,
and I'd be [grateful for feedback][email] on what else you'd like to see included.
