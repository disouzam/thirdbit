Is there a MastodonConf yet?
It would be near the top of my must-do list:
the combination of tech talks about scaling federated services
with process talks on encouraging or enforcing social rules for distributed content moderation
and social scientists analyzing how people are adapting legacy (Twitter-era) practices
to a similar-but-different ecosystem
would be fascinating.
