Suppose you have a grid that's W squares wide and H squares tall.
How many different ways can you cover it with rectangular tiles?
It's easy enough to work out the answer for specific cases:

| Grid Size | Number of Tilings |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1x1       | 1                 |
| 1x2       | 2                 |
| 2x2       | 8                 |

but I can't figure out the formula for the general caseâ€”a simple recursive formula
double-counts configurations like the four size-one squares in the diagram above.
I also can't figure out a simple way to calculate the answer programmatically;
help with both would be greatly appreciated.
