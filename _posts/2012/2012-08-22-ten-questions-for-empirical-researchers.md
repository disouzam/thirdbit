<p>I gave the opening talk at <a href="http://msrcanada.org/msrvision2020/">MSR Vision 2020</a> in Kingston on Monday (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/two-solitudes">slides</a>), and in the wake of that, an experienced developers at Mozilla sent me a list of ten questions he'd really like empirical software engineering researchers to answer. They're interesting in their own right, but I think they also reveal a lot about what practitioners want from researchers in general; comments would be very welcome.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Vi vs. Emacs vs. graphica editors/IDEs: which makes me more productive?</li>
  <li>Should language developers spend their time on tools, syntax, library, or something else (like speed)? What makes the most difference to their users?</li>
  <li>Do unit tests save more time in debugging than they take to write/run/keep updated?</li>
  <li>Do distribution version control systems offer any advantages over centralized version control systems? (As a sub-question, Git or Mercurial: which helps me make fewer mistakes/shows me the info I need faster?)</li>
  <li>What are the best debugging techniques?</li>
  <li>Is it really twice as hard to debug as it is to write the code in the first place?</li>
  <li>What are the differences (bug count, code complexity, size, etc.), if any, between community-driven open source projects and corporate-controlled open source projects?</li>
  <li>If 10,000-line projects don't benefit from architecture, but 100,000-line projects do, what do you do when your project slowly grows from the first size to the second?</li>
  <li>When does it make sense to reinvent the wheel vs. use an existing library?</li>
  <li>Are conferences worth the money? How much do they help junior/intermediate/senior programmers?</li>
</ol>
