Apple's announcement, blah blah blahâ€“I think Audrey Watters' "<a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/01/19/apple-and-the-textbook-counter-revolution/">Apple and the Digital Textbook Counter-revolution"</a> sums it up best. So what <em>should</em> a "textbook" for a webified world look like? <a href="http://educationaltechnologyguy.blogspot.com/2012/01/what-i-use-with-physics-classes-instead.html">David Andrade's description</a> of what he does in his physics course, and Frank Noschese's "<a href="http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/my-vision-for-a-physics-ibook/">Vision for a Physics iBook</a>" are much better answers.
