<p>Hot on the heels of Cait Pickens' posts about our workshop at the Scripps Institute comes <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2012-scripps-swc-postmortem.html">this post-mortem</a> from Titus Brown. Again, there's lots of good analysis, and many useful recommendations&mdash;particularly concerning installation and setup headaches (which continue to be our second-biggest problem).</p>
