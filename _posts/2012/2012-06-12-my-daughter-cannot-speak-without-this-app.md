Maya is a little girl who faces <a href="http://niederfamily.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/silencing-of-maya.html">some big challenges</a>:

Now, Prentke Romich Company and Semantic Compaction Systems want to take away the software that let her say, "Daddy, I love you," for the very first time. It's all about patents, except it's not: it's about big companies abusing the patent system to smother smaller ones.

I don't normally get involved in online campaigns, or ask other people to, but this one's different. Apple recently took down the app that lets Maya speak because the patent dispute hadn't been resolved, and there's the very real risk that they might disable it remotely. Please tell them, and Prentke Romich, what you think, and please show your support for Speak for Yourself (the company that makes the app).
