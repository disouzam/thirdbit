<p>We received this by email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use version control for my software, and I encourage others to do so, but I have no experimental evidence to base that decision. I pulled out my old copy of <cite>Code Complete</cite> (it's a first edition), and the only reference it makes is to "Moore 1992", which is a private communication that says that Microsoft considers their internal use of version control to be a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The common practices I know of are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>no version control</li>
  <li>every once in a while make a backup, either as a tar/zip file or copy everything into a new directory</li>
  <li>use filesystem versioning, like what was on a VAX, or Time Machine on a Mac, or Dropbox for a distributed multi-version file system</li>
  <li>- use a version control system; though this in turn can vary from SCCS and RCS to Fossil and Veracity</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, there's a difference between the needs of a single developer vs. a small team, vs. a large, distributed team.</p>
<p>Is there published experimental evidence showing that a version control system is more useful than, say, developing using Dropbox? I tried looking for the relevant papers but I don't know how to search that field and I couldn't find anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a good questionâ€“does anyone have an answer?</p>
