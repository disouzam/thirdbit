  <em>
    I have sometimes dreamt that when the Day of Judgment dawns and
    great conquerors and lawyers and statesmen come to receive their
    rewards–their crowns, their laurels, their names carved
    indelibly upon imperishable marble–the Almighty will turn to
    Peter and will say, not without a certain envy when He sees us
    coming with our books under our arms, "Look, these need no
    reward. We have nothing to give them. They have loved reading."
    <br>
    – Virginia Woolf
