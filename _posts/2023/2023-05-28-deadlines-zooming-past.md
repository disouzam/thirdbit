I intended to wrap up the Python version of *[Software Design by Example][sdxjs]*
by the end of May.
Instead,
with three days to go,
I'm just a hair over three-quarters done:

Editing the videos for [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit]'s April 2023 lightning talks
accounts for a bit of the slippage,
but only a bit:
mostly,
I'm just finding it hard to focus on teaching people how to design software
when (a) there's been less interest in the JavaScript version of the book than I'd hoped for
and (b) it's clear that stochastic parrots are going to revolutionize the act of programming
in ways we can't yet imagine.
On the other hand,
I really enjoyed teaching [this class][class]
and hope to run it again over the summer
to validate changes and additions to the lessons.
Onwardâ€¦
