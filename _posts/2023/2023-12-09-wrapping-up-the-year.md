With 22 days left in the year,
I think it's safe to do a retrospective on
[my goals]({{'/2023/01/01/plans-for-the-year/' | relative_url}}):

-   Finish one of the books I've had on the go for the last few years and sell  one short story:
    nope.
-   Wrap up the Python version of *Software Design by Example*:
    yup.
-   Help organize another series of lightning talks for *It Will Never Work in Theory*:
    yup,
    but we then wound the project down.
    I don't know what it will take to get programmers and researchers to talk to one another,
    but *NWIT* ain't it.
-   Refurbish my dad's reclining chair:
    yup.
-   Terrace the back half of our back yard:
    nope,
    but we did get some new windows in.
-   Pick up another musical instrument:
    nope.
    Between the tenosynovitis in my right hand and wrist pain in my left,
    the only instrument I could possibly play right now is the trombone,
    and I don't think my neighbors would appreciate it.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not,
be damned with you.
