I <s>plan</s> hope to spend February and March revising
the Python version of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs].
I'm thinking about creating a slide deck for each of the chapters
to help me do thatâ€”boiling things down to point form
helps me see what's out of order or missing entirely.
The best way to test a slide deck is to teach from it,
so I'd like to know who'd be interested in
an hour-a-week online class that taught participants
how to build a dozen applications from the list below in Python:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6" markdown="1">
-   a testing framework
-   an interpreter
-   a versioned file backup system
-   a file cache
-   a dataframe
-   an object persistence framework
-   a binary storage framework
-   a build manager
-   a static site generator
</div>
<div class="col-6" markdown="1">
-   a page layout engine
-   a text editor
-   a web server
-   a package manager
-   a regular expression matcher
-   a regular expression parser
-   a style checker
-   a virtual machine
-   a debugger
</div>
</div>

The cost would be a donation equivalent to a day's pay
to a mutually-agreed charity.
Breaking that down:

-   I'm not trying to make money from this,
    but I've learned the hard way that
    participation in free classes drops off dramatically
    (life gets in the way of good intentions).

-   I want to make the lessons accessible to as many people as possible,
    so "a day of your salary" in exchange for a dozen hours of instruction
    (plus online chat outside class, feedback on homework, etc.)
    seems a good way to adjust the cost automatically.

-   The charity has to be one we agree on because
    you might want to support causes I'm uncomfortable with and vice versa.

If you're interested, please [let me know](mailto:{{site.author.email}});
if a dozen people are willing to commit, I think it would be a lot of fun.
