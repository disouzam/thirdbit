I promised myself I wouldn't write any more technical books,
but it seems a shame to leave my notes on undergraduate team projects
languishing in a Git repository,
so I'm going to tidy them up and post them on this site.
The first few sections are up at <https://gvwilson.github.io/btt/>;
I'll blog and toot as others become available.
Feedback is always appreciated;
in particular,
I'd be very grateful for comments from people
who have taught undergraduate course with names like "Intro to Software Engineering"
in which students do team projects.
