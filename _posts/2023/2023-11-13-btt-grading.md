As I wrote [yesterday]({{"/2023/11/12/reviving-btt/" | relative_url}}),
I'm tidying up my notes on how to run undergraduate software engineering course projects
and posting them [here]({{"/btt/" | relative_url}}).
The [notes on grading]({{"/btt/grading/" | relative_url}}) have just gone up,
and I'd be grateful for feedback from people who've taught courses of this kind:
please [email me](mailto:{{site.author.email}})
or file issues in [the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/gvwilson/btt/).
