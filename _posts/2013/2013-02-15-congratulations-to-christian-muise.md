<p>U of Toronto PhD student Christian Muise created an application that was selected as a winner of Google's Places API Challenge. The competition brought together 87 developers from 27 countries, challenging them to build apps that address some of the most pressing needs in our communities. The top three applications were declared winners, and will be showcased at Google I/O, the company's annual developer conference.</p>
<p>Muise's award-winning app, TTC Pass, is "a website that allows for collaborative editing of the locations for purchasing various transit fares" in Toronto. See a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xJATLTHmPs">video of the app</a>, or the <a href="href=">Google Places API Developer Challenge webpage</a>.</p>
