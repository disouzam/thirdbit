I received this a couple of days ago—regardless of whether some form of licensure would be a good idea or not, I think it's bound to happen eventually, and the IEEE will be a major player.

The IEEE Computer Society—the world's leading provider of technical information and services to the world's computing professionals—is developing a program to certify entry-level software developers and engineers. Called the Certified Software Development Associate Program, this program will provide formal recognition of entry-level professionals who have achieved a level of proficiency commonly accepted and valued by the industry and will complement our certification program for mid-level software developers and engineers, the Certified Software Development Professional.  To recruit beta testers of the certification exam, we are waiving the test fee for the first 200 qualified candidates. For the beta test only, the Computer Society seeks students in their final year of a program leading to a baccalaureate or equivalent degree and entry-level software developers and engineers who have graduated with a baccalaureate or equivalent degree since November of 2004.

We need at least 200 beta testers to validate content and establish a pass/fail rate. Candidates who pass the beta test will receive the CSDA credential and receive recognition in Computer Society publications and on its Website. We plan to promote the value of the CSDA credential to industry worldwide.

We're accepting applications through December 28. The exam may be taken through January 31.  Click here for an application to participate in the beta test, or visit http://www.computer.org/certification/csda for additional information about the program, including the content outline of the exam.  Please forward this to your entry-level colleagues, students, and anyone else you feel might benefit from this opportunity. For questions, contact certification@computer.org. Thank you for supporting this program.
