<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">Titus Brown</a> will be teaching "<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/apr-07/class-blurb.html">Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry with Python</a>" at <a href="http://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> this spring, and is open to teaching it elsewhere after that.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://gotgenes.com/">Chris Lasher</a> has put together some more debugging material for the course.  As mentioned previously, they're planning to run a writing spree at SciPy'07; hope to see lots of people there.
