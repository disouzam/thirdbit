A couple of months ago I gave the <a href="http://www.drproject.org/olm">OLM</a> team a copy of Steve Souders' book <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514211/"><em>High Performance Web Sites</em></a>.  Since then, they've improved <a href="http://www.drproject.org/olm">OLM</a>'s performance several times over, in part based on Souders' advice.  Last week, one of the team told me about <a href="http://com3.devnet.re3.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a>, a Firefox plugin that implements Souders' rules.  (See <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/oscon_yahoo_rel.html">here</a> for the OSCON announcement.)  That led to a discussion of whether tools like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> would one day merge.  Personally, I think that future is already here: it's still just very unevenly distributed...
