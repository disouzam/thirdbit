A long time ago, I asked if Groovy (a new scripting language built on top of the JVM) was dead --- I was, briefly, HP's representative on the JSR, but bowed out when it became clear that it was going to be another Perl (i.e., semantics defined by whatever had recently been thrown into the implementation).

Well, they've <a href="http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=200">released 1.0</a>, and there's even a <a href="http://www.manning.com/koenig/"><em>Groovy in Action</em></a> book from <a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning</a> to go with it.  Kind of feels like building a barn after the horse has learned to drive, but I wish them the best...
