Titus Brown and Chris Lasher are putting together a <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jul-07">Software Carpentry writing sprint</a> for SciPy'07.  I can't go down to the conference this year (family commitments), but if you can, and you'd like to help make Software Carpentry even better, please give them a shout.
