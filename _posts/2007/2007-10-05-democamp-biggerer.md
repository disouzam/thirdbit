Thanks to Sara Franca, the CS department's wonderful communications officer, we have managed to get a larger venue for DemoCamp 15.  Another 50 tickets are available right now, and 100 more will be released next week—you can grab 'em from <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com">democamp.eventbrite.com</a>.  Doors open at 3:00, demos start at 4:00, and we have the room (and bar) 'til 7:00—look forward to seeing lots of you there.

p.s. thanks, Sara.
