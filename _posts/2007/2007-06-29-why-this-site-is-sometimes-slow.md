I have figured out why third-bit.com crawls from time to time: this blog is being inundated by a wave of comment spam.  I'm using the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> plugin to filter it (I delete several hundred to several thousand spam comments a day, unread), but filing them away to be rejected is enough of a load on my server to constitute a denial of service attack in its own right :-(.  I'm now thinking about relocating this domain and <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca">StreetKnit</a> to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">dreamhost.com</a> or some other hosting serviceâ€”I hope that'll provide more uniform service levels.
