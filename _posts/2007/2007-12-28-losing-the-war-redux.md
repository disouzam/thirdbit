Twenty minutes ago, I read a <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20071228/index.html">post</a> by Diomidis Spinellis in which he cites instructions from the new Sony Ericsson K770i's owner's manual telling people to reboot their phone every day because of a memory leak. Fifteen minutes ago, I tried to buy a movie from Rogers On Demand (my cable provider) for the first time, and had to reboot my PVR twice as a result --- apparently, "it's a known issue, and we're working to resolve it as quickly as we can". *sigh*
