End-of-the-month report time (while the baby is sleeping). Here's what traffic has looked like on the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> site since it opened:

And here's this month on the Third Bit blog:

In order, the spikes are:
<ul>
	<li>Interviewing at Google (until recently my most-favorite-ever posting)</li>
	<li>the first post about <em>Beautiful Code</em></li>
	<li>the updated chapter list for <em>Beautiful Code<em>
</em></a></li>
	<li>the list of organizations participating in Google Summer of Code</li>
	<li>my daughter's birth announcement</li>
</ul>
Google Analytics (the source of the information on this blog) also provides geographic information; I know it's not 100% accurate, since it's not showing visitors from continental Africa or Mexico, but it's still pretty cool:

The coolest thing? Sadie and I have had congratulations on Madeleine's birth from every continent except Antarctica ;-).
