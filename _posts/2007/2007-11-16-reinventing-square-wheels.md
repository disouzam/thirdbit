New motto: those who won't learn from the past don't deserve any sympathy.  What brings this up is a recent post describing <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp11137.html">the fork-join framework proposal for Java 7</a>. Been there, done that, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8185">wrote a book about it</a>â€”unless/until a framework-aware debugger comes along, it's not going to make any difference.
