David Crow has posted an <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1678/democamptoronto-update">update on the status of DemoCamp 14</a> (Sept 17, downtown, registration free but required).  It looks like a cool lineup of demos, and yours truly will be giving a five-minute talk on <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>. Hope to see lots of you thereâ€¦
