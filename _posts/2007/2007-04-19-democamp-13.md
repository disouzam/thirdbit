The next DemoCamp (number 13) is Tuesday, April 24, at <a href="http://www.no-regrets.ca/">No Regrets</a>.  The <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto13">schedule</a> looks pretty interesting: a couple of longer presentations, and then some lightning demos of really truly running products no sales presentations thank you very much.  I probably won't be there (babies take precedence ;-), but I look forward to hearing about it from all of you.
