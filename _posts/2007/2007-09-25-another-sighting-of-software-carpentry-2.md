<a href="http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~zito/">Tiziano Zito</a> is teaching <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> in <a href="http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~zito/teaching/SC/">Berlin</a>.  I admit I'm biased, but I think that's pretty cool ;-)  Traffic on the site is holding steady as well --- wish I had time to go back and update the notes...
