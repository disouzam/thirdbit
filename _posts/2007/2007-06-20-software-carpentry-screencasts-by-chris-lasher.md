Chris Lasher, a grad student at <strike>the University of Virginia</strike> Virginia Tech (sorry, sorry), has posted some <a href="http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=bfNi2X3Xg">screencasts about version control</a> based on the Software Carpentry notes at <a href="http://www.showmedo.com">ShowMeDo.com</a>; a second series about using the shell should be up shortly.  It's just plain cool to see the material picked up and carried forward in ways I wouldn't even have thought of a couple of years ago.

<em>Later: now there's <a href="http://www.bioscreencast.com">Bioscreencast.com</a>, </em> the <a href="http://www.jove.com/">Journal of Visual Experiments</a>, and othersâ€”the world moves on.
