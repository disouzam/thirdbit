<p><a href="http://www.vrplumber.com/">Mike Fletcher</a> gave a pep talk at last night's <a href="http://web.engcorp.com/pygta/wiki/NextMeeting">PyGTA</a> meeting for the <a href="http://www.laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project.  They showed off some actual hardware (yay), but the project isn't as far along as I'd thought: major systems are still being designed, and parts of those designs are still in the wishlist stage.  As I've <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/848.html">said before</a>, though, it's an exciting time; if you want to get into open source, here's a chance to touch the lives of millions.</p>
