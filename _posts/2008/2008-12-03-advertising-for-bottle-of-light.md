My dad (a former English teacher) sent me a scan of an advertising flyer from Scholastic Canada that includes my latest children's book, <em>A Bottle of Light</em>. As I've said <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1657.html">before</a>, it's only available in school reading programs, not bookstores, but it's still pretty cool.
