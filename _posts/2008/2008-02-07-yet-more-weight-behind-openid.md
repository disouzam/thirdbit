This morning the <a href="http://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> announced that <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=818650" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=818650?ref=http_//radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/02/openid_foundati.html');">Google, IBM, Microsoft, VeriSign, and Yahoo! have joined the board</a>.  We really need to get this into DrProject --- I'm definitely proposing it as a Google Summer of Code project this year. (If it's <a href="https://openid.ee/about/english">good enough for Estonia</a>, it's good enough for me ;-)).
