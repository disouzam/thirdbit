I got my first two copies of <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1280.html"><em>A Bottle of Light</em></a> last week, and immediately handed them off to my nephews (to whom the book is dedicated).  About half an hour ago, the postman delivered a (small) box full --- w00t!  It's only available through a special reading program that Scholastic is running in schools, rather than regular and online bookstores, but I'm still happy enough to see it to grin a cheesy grin:

<em>Update: thanks to everyone for the congratulations. Unfortunately, "Bottle of Light" is part of what Scholastic calls a directed reading program, which means it's only available *in* schools --- not even the kids can buy copies to take home to read themselves.  The <a href="http://www.scholastic.ca/education/movingupwithliteracyplace/">program's web site</a> doesn't say much about the pedagogical theory behind this; if I can find out more about their reasoning, I'll let you know.</em>
