I used to write for <a href="http://www.newscientist.com"><em>New Scientist</em></a> occasionally; now I just enjoy reading it, and no more so than when they run articles like <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/dn13647">this one</a>, in which 17 leading scientists are asked to name a books that changed their lives, and readers are invited to submit theirs. Neat.
