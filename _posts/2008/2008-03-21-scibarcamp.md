I couldn't attend the first <a href="http://www.scibarcamp.org/">SciBarCamp</a> last weekend (I was three time zones away), but <em>Nature</em> magazine said <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2008/03/the_week_on_nature_network_21.html">good</a> <a href="http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/U66E7CD1A/2008/03/19/what-should-everyone-know-about-science">things</a>, as <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/SciBarCamp">others</a>.  W00t!
