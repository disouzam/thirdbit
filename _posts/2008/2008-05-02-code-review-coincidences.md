I discovered during my Wednesday trip to the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a> that they do extensive code reviews in house. Coincidentally, Guido van Rossum sent <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2008-May/013408.html">mail</a> to the Python 3000 list the next day saying that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMql3Di4Kgc">the code review tool he built for Google</a> isn't going to be released, but <a href="http://codereview.appspot.com/">one designed to work with Subversion is</a>, and Christian Hammond offered f<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss/browse_thread/thread/6bd9c59d705f1d2d">ree Review Board hosting</a> for Summer of Code projects.  The <a href="http://smartbear.com/docs/book/code-review-cisco-case-study.pdf">study that Smart Bear Software did at Cisco</a> convinced me that code reviews can actually work (I was sceptical for a long time, as I though they fell into the "nice, but people won't actually do it" bucket).  Maybe their time has finally come?
