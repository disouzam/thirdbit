I was talking to my software engineering class about code reviews last week, while simultaneously thinking about how to replace the wiki parser in DrProject.  Two birds one stone, I decided to review <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">a wiki parser written in Python</a> and keep notes on what I was thinking as I went through it.  I've posted the result as a separate page on this web site; I'd be interested in comments and feedback.

<em>Later: Diomidis Spinellis posted <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20041125/">a similar think-aloud</a> back in 2004 that's worth reading.</em>
