A year and a bit ago, I posted pictures of DrProject's database schema and architecture. I'm happy with the former—the only thing I'd do differently is make it larger and add comments (or change field names to be more descriptive)—but the latter still bugs me.  It doesn't carry as much information as a napkin sketch of a user interface, much less an architectural blueprint.  I've looked at lots of books on software architecture (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Primer-John-Reekie/dp/0646458418">Reekie &amp; McAdam</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Software-Architecture-Ian-Gorton/dp/3540287132">Gorton</a> being my favorites), but I still haven't found a notation that seems like good value for time.  If you know of one, I'd welcome a pointer…
