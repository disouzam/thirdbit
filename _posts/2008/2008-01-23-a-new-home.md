After almost five years of sterling service, we have finally retired our old server and bought a domain at <a href="http://www.site5.com">site5.com</a>. Many, many thanks to Jon Pipitone for doing all the heavy lifting to do this for both <a href="http://www.third-bit.com">third-bit.com</a> and <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca">streetknit.ca</a>.
