1731 people have completed our survey of <a href="http://softwareresearch.ca/seg/SCS/scientific-computing-survey.html">how scientists use computers</a> since it went online three weeks ago.  That's pretty cool, but I'd like to double the number (at least).  If you consider yourself a working scientist, and haven't taken the survey yet, please take a moment and do so.  If you aren't a scientist, but know some, please pass on the link:
