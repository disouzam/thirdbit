I'd like to be a better teacher.  In particular, I'd like to drag my teaching practices into the 21st Century and start doing more with the Interweb than bulletin boards and static HTML slides. I picked up a couple of highly-rated books, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Online-Learning-Idea-Book-Technology-Based/dp/0787981680">first</a> didn't contain anything that wasn't obvious, while the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/e-Learning-Science-Instruction-Guidelines-Multimedia/dp/0787986836">second</a> was a good example of stilted, pompous academese at its worst. I'd therefore like to find a mentor here in Toronto---someone who's using modern technology for teaching in creative, innovative ways, and is willing to take about her/his experiences.  If you know someone who fits the bill (or better yet, <em>are</em> that person), please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu">drop me a line</a>.
