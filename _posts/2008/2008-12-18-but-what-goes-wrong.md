Nice video about "<a href="http://teachweb2.blogspot.com/2008/11/cck08-connectivism-networked-studentthe.html">connected learning</a>" --- the latest incarnation of the idea that teachers should teach students how to find and evaluate information, so that students can find and connect ideas on the web themselves to create a customized learning experience.  I'm sure it works well if everyone involved is honest, committed, energetic, and altruistic, but then, so would communism :-)  As with any social innovation, the key question is how it will perform in the hands of people who <em>aren't</em> fired up about it.  Sadly, that one's left unanswered...
