Toronto-area startup <a href="http://learnhub.com">LearnHub.com</a> has launched their new e-learning site with <a href="http://swc.learnhub.com/">part</a> of the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> course as their featured offering.  I'm looking forward to meeting a whole new batch of students... ;-)
