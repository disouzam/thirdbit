As reported earlier, the Computing Community Consortium asked people to submit "game-changing advances" from computer research. Results are <a href="http://www.cccblog.org/2008/11/30/game-changing-advances-from-computing-research-followup/">now up on their site</a>, and include:
<ul>
  <li>The Internet and the World Wide Web</li>
  <li>Search technology</li>
  <li>Cluster computing</li>
  <li>The transformation of science via computation</li>
  <li>Secure communication</li>
  <li>Mobile computing</li>
  <li>Expert systems</li>
  <li>Everyday robotics</li>
  <li>Digital media</li>
  <li>Mapping &amp; navigation</li>
  <li>Recommendation systems</li>
</ul>
Still nothing from software engineering, though...
