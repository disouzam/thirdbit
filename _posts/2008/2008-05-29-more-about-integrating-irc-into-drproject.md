Kosta has posted <a href="http://drprojectirc.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/plan-for-logs-pt-2/">some more thoughts</a> about integrating IRC into <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>. He's still working on mechanisms, but I'm looking ahead to the user interface. In particular, how should IRC logs be displayed? His first pass will be a "magic" wiki page that conversation entries are appended to (or possibly one separate "magic" page for each IRC conversation topic).  That will work for short projects, but:
<ol>
	<li>What happens with something like <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> itself, which could have tens of thousands of lines of conversation after a year has gone by? Even in undergrad course projects, there are likely to be thousands of lines in a term. Email is naturally segmented into chunks; what is the chunking (if any) for chat?</li>
	<li>What happens to the event log? We clearly don't want one entry in the log for each IRC chat message---what should we show instead?</li>
</ol>
Thoughts?
