Madeleine started walking on Saturday.  Nothing tentative about it---she just decided she was done with crawling, so she started staggering like a drunken Finn in high seas across the living room floor.  And the kitchen floor.  And the upstairs hallway.  And, well, you get the picture.  Yay Maddie!
