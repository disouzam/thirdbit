<p>In the last couple of years, people have taken to calling Perl, Python, Ruby, and their kin "agile" languages.  The term is pure marketing hype: "agile" is obviously a good thing, and it implies (without actually saying) that compiled, statically-typed languages like C++, Java, and C# are clumsy, plodding things, fit to be used only by programmers who drag their knuckles when they walk and need UML diagrams to show them how to pick their noses.</p>

<p>In the interest of fair play (and to stir things a little), I'd like to find an adjective to use for the non-agile languages of the world which is just as biased as "agile".  "Robust"?  "Sturdy"?  "Predictable"?  If possible, it should be an antonym of "agile", but a complimentary one.  Please send your suggestions to me; I'll add a comment to this posting when I have a handful for consideration.</p>
