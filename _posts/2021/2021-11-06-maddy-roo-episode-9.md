*Click. Click. Click.*
One by one the ceiling lights that had come on behind them went out.
*Bzzzt... Bzzzt...*
Two more lights in front of them flickered to life.

"You're smothering me,"
Sindy said,
her voice muffled by Maddy's suddenly-tighter hug.

"Sorry."
Maddy released her little sister and swallowed.
Maybe the darkness hadn't been so bad after all...

The hard white light showed what Dockety's chest lamp had not.
Faint water stains blotched the walls of the corridor.
Here and there shallow scorch marks ran across the concrete.
Maddy had never seen them before,
but she recognized them instantly from stories:
they were laser burns.

The hole that Dockety had almost fallen into took up three quarters of the corridor.
Its edges and corners were too square to be natural,
and after a moment Maddy realized that
half a dozen of the concrete blocks the floor was made of
had fallen into a space below them,
leaving just enough room on one side to get past walking single file.

"Well?" the crackly voice said,
still cheerful but slightly impatient.
"What are you waiting for?"

Maddy looked at Dockety.
The bot's heavy manipulator snapped open and closed,
open and closed.
"We have no alternative," it finally said.

Maddy nodded.
"I'll go first.
Sindy, you stay here 'til we know it's safe."

Taking a deep breath,
she put one foot on the ledge beside the hole.
The floor *felt* solid,
even when she gingerly shifted her weight onto it.
She edged across with her back pressed against the wall,
shuffling her feet and definitely *not* looking
into the hole whose bottom she still couldn't see.
What if whoever had spoken to them suddenly decided to turn the lights off again?
She would be aright, she told herself sternly.
She would just keep going,
or shuffle back to where Dockety stood motionless
while Sindy wrung her paws.

And then she was on the other side.
She let her breath out with a whoosh,
suddenly realizing how long it had been since she peed.
"Come on,"
she encouraged her sister.
"It's fine, I promise."

Sindy nodded jerkily.
Instead of putting her back against the wall she pressed herself against it.
Slide, slide, slide---she practically leaped into Maddy's arms once she was across.
"You did great," the older roo whispered into her little round ear.

"Thanks," Sindy said, wriggling out of Maddy's arms.
"Come on, it's easy!" she called back to Dockety.

"Not in this one's configuration," the bot replied.
It couldn't side-walk, Maddy realized:
its legs only bent one way,
and its body was too wide to---

Without warning the bot retracted its legs and dropped its wheel.
Its engine whined as it zipped back ten meters,
then roared as it raced toward the hole.
"Whoa!" Maddy shouted as it punched the floor with both of its feet,
throwing itself into the air.

*Thud!*
Dockety's wheel left a dark streak on the floor as it braked.
It folded the wheel back up into its body and re-extended its legs.

"That was amazing," Maddy said, awed.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"Thank you.
But it has almost completely drained this one's batteries.
We should proceed."

The lights led them away from the hole.
Every few steps one went dark behind them and another brightened in front.
When they reached a four-way junction,
the lights showed them they should go left,
then down another flight of stairs to a small landing that ended in an open door
even thicker than the one at the surface.

"Whoa..." Maddy breathed.
The room beyond the door seemed almost as big as the central square of Rusty Bridge.
Desks and control panels stood in neat rows,
interrupted every few meters by square metal pillars.

"Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!" the crackly voice said.
A bot decorated with twists of metal,
glued-on pictures faded to illegibility,
and things Maddy filed away to have nightmares about later
rolled forward.
"Welcome! This is Patient in Darkness" it proclaimed proudly.

"That's a strange name,"
Sindy said before Maddy could speak.

A little fan stuck to the bot's shoulder spun for a moment.
"This one chose the name itself,"
the strange bot crackled.
"It is an accurate designation of activity.
Observe!"

All the lights went out.
Maddy instinctively put a hand on Sindy's shoulder.
"I'm sorry," Maddy said as calmly as she could.
"She didn't mean to be rude.
It's a lovely name."

"Sh!" the bot said sharply.
"These must *listen* to darkness if they want to hear the signal."

Maddy closed her eyes---somehow,
darkness was less frightening when it was on the backs of her eyelids.
She listened as hard as she could,
but all she could hear was her own breathing and a sniffle from her sister.

The lights came back on.
"Did you hear it?" the bot asked happily.
"The signal is always there if you listen."

"What does it say?"
Maddy asked.

"This one does not know."
The bot turned from side to side on its four wide tires.
"But the satellites are definitely still transmitting.
And this one has kept this ground station functioning at optimal levels,"
it added proudly.

"That's---that's really good,"
Maddy said weakly,
wondering if the bits of metal welded to the bot's casing were some kind of strange electronics
or actually the old spoons they looked like.

"It is *optimal*," the bot corrected.
"Though unfortunately the main antenna malfunctioned some time ago.
That was not this one's fault."

"These did not notice an antenna when they entered this facility,"
Dockety said,
speaking for the first time since they had entered the room.

Patient in Darkness froze for an instant.
"Does *that* have a proper work allocation??
it asked pointedly.
"No? Then its communication is irrelevant."

Maddy glanced at Dockety.
The bot did not reply.
As the silence stretched awkwardly,
she said,
"Um...we didn't see an antenna when we came in?"

"Correct,"
Patient replied in its previous cheerful tone.
"But that will soon be rectified.
This one has devised emergency repair protocols.
The required components are now being fabricated.
The Makers will be pleased,"
it finished proudly.

Maddy's breath caught in her throat.
"The Makers?
You work for the *Makers*?"

Patient brushed the question away with a wave of one its arms.
It had three,
Maddy realized,
each one so different from the others
that they might all have been salvaged.
"We all work for the Makers,"
the bot said earnestly.
"And when They return,
They will upgrade those who have served Them best."

"Um... aright."
Maddy nodded cautiously.
"And your job is repairing the antenna.
Got it.
Mm hm."

Sindy tugged on her sleeve.
"Ask it if there's anything to eat,"
she whispered loudly.

"Organic sustenance is not stored at this site,"
Patient said before Maddy could repeat her sister's request.
"That would be inefficient.
They will not reward inefficiency."

"I guess.
Would it be aright if we slept here for a bit?
That wouldn't, um, that wouldn't be inefficient, would it?
We could listen for a bit too if you wanted,"
she added hastily.
"To the signal, I mean.
Maybe we could hear something while we slept."

Maddy knew her words made no sense,
but she didn't care.
She was exhausted and hungry and a long way from home
and it was taking everything she had not to let herself be frightened,
and for all she knew they *would* hear something---after everything
that had happened in the last few hours,
she wouldn't rule it out.

The bot rolled back and forth a couple of times.
"Excellent plan," it finally crackled.
"This one will continue overseeing repairs while you are unconscious."
It spun around and wheeled away.

"That one's *weird*," Sindy muttered.

Maddy squeezed her shoulder.
"Yeah, but at least we're somewhere clean and dry
and there aren't any tentacle things trying to grab us.
Why don't you go find us somewhere to lie down?
I need to talk to Dockety for a moment."

The younger roo yawned and nodded.
"You aright?"
Maddy asked Dockety tentatively once Sindy was out of earshot.

The bot's lenses rotated.
"It would have been more consistent with protocol
for that one to offer recharging capacity,"
it said neutrally.
"But this one can see several compatible ports.
It will take approximately four hours to---"

"Maddy! Maddy!"
Sindy hurried back, eyes wide.
"You gotta come see this.
You gotta come!"
She grabbed her sister's sleeve and tugged on it urgently.

*I knew it was too good to be true,*
Maddy thought a few moments later,
staring through heavy double-paned glass at
what had once been a laboratory of some kind.
A cloudy patch in the middle of the glass
showed where someone had tried to melt it
or dissolve it with acid.
The four skeletons---no, there were five, she realized distantly---showed that
whatever the room's occupants had tried hadn't worked.
Neither, apparently, had setting a fire:
one of the lab benches had scorch marks,
and there was a dark stain on the ceiling that covered half of one of the room's lights.

"Maybe it happened by accident,"
Maddy ventured.
"Maybe they got locked in accidentally and just...just couldn't get out."

"Negative."
They jumped as Patient crackled right behind them.
""They declined to synchronize with the emergency repair protocol,
so they were moved to long-term storage.
Their components failed shortly thereafter."
The fan on its shoulder spun furiously.
"It is unfortunate.
This one estimates that the cleanup necessitated by the incident
delayed completion of repairs by almost eighty-one hours."

Maddy nodded jerkily.
The bot was between them and the door they had come through.
She could see other doors,
but what chance did they have if it could control the lights?
And was it *humming*?

It was.
She even recognized the tune:
it was the one her parents had used to teach her the alphabet.
Hearing it come from a patchwork bot big enough for her and her sister to ride on
was the most frightening thing that had happened to her that day.

"Well, um, we shouldn't keep you from it,"
Maddy said brightly,
backing away slowly with her arm out to keep Sindy behind her.
"The repairs, I mean.
We can sleep anywhere, honestly.
We'll just, um, we'll just go and you can get back on schedule, aright?"

"Oh no,"
Patient said.
"Leaving is not included in the protocol.
It might put the repairs at risk.
You will remain here."

A single square light panel flickered to life
in the ceiling of the lab next to the one containing the skeletons.
With a quiet, menacing *click*,
the lab's door opened.

"Except for that one,"
the mad bot added dismissively,
waving a manipulator at Dockety.
"That will be recycled."

"No," Dockety said flatly.
"This one has its own mission to complete."

"Its mission is irrelevant."
Patient wheeled backward to a console.
Its spindly third arm reached out and pressed a series of buttons in rapid succession.

A pair of double doors whooshed open in the wall to Maddy's right.
Two bulky service bots that looked like small versions of the cargo hauler rolled forward,
arms raised and red warning lights flashing on their shoulders.
