Maddy's initial fright at being airborne
was instantly replaced by full-blown terror.
There was just enough light for her to see how high they were
and how far they'd have to fall if Dockety let go or her coat tore
or one of the straps broke or---
She suddenly remembered its arm coming off
and all she could think about was,
*What if it happens again?*

But Sindy was shrieking with joy.
"We're flying! We're flying!" she shouted,
barely audible above the thunder of the rotor on Dockety's back.
"Look!"
To their left,
the dark towers of the bot fortress of Heck stood in grim ranks on the horizon.
Below,
the Rusty River slunk through the Mire,
a brown-green streak that didn't so much parallel the road as skulk beside it.
Green bubbles swelled and burst here and there in little splattery burps.

Dockety banked in a long slow curve and straightened out again,
steering them away from the road and river.
Maddy wiped her eyes over and over,
blinking and squinting against the wind of their passage.
She had no idea how fast they were going,
but they zoomed past the frightened birds
that scattered from the trees below them.

"How long 'til we're home?" she shouted to Dockety.

"Unknown," the robot replied.
"This one has disabled the autopilot to forestall any attempts at subversion,
so maps are not available."

"Look Maddy--we saw that last night!"
Sindy pointed at the sunken metal sphere
Maddy had seen the bots' raiding party pass on screen.
She whooped.
They were halfway home!

But before she could tell Sindy,
Dockety started to dive,
shallow at first and then steeper.
Maddy clutched her sister's arm.
"What's happening?" she shouted.

"We are being pursued,"
Dockety said as it leveled off frighteningly close to the treetops.

Maddy twisted around as far as she could in her harness
but couldn't see anything.
"They're right behind us!" Sindy shouted,
looking upside-down through her own legs.

Maddy gulped and did the same.
For a moment everything swam around her
as the forest became her ceiling and the sky---she swallowed hard.
*Don't throw up,* she pleaded with her stomach.

There---behind them,
two dark shapes were flying side by side
parallel to their course.
They had wings instead of rotors
and were carrying canisters
like the ones that had been stacked on the shelves in the armory.

"I don't think they're chasing us,"
she shouted.

"Agreed."
Dockety banked around a particularly tall pine tree.
"They are part of the attack."

Maddy clenched her paws.
"Can you go any faster?"

"Not safely,"
the bot answered,
but put on speed anyway.

On and on they went.
Trees and streams and ponds slid away beneath them.
Birds and rabbits scattered at the sound of Dockety's rotor,
and once Maddy saw a deer and a fawn run along a path
and disappear into the forest shadows.

Her nose found Rusty Bridge before her eyes did.
Coffee and baking bread---it smelled like morning.
"There!" she yelled, pointing.

"We're home!" Sindy shouted.
"We're home!
Look, that's our house!"

But Maddy had already figured out where they needed to be.
"Head for the square!"
she ordered Dockety,
pointing.
"We have to warn everyone about the attack!"

*Thump!*
Something black shot into the air just in front of them.
For a moment Maddy thought it was a flock of startled crows,
but it was a net,
spreading as it spun through the air.

*Thump!*
"Look out!"
she shouted needlessly
as Dockety banked away from a second shot.
The militia must have set up the tangle cannon after the previous attack!
They didn't know Dockety was on their side!

"Behind us!
Look behind us!" she yelled at the people on the ground,
knowing they couldn't hear.

*Thump!*
*Thud!*
The third shot hit them.
The net was made of rough brown string,
the kind people used in their gardens.
It cut through the fur on Maddy's cheek,
drawing blood,
then wrapped around them.
The weights on its fringes clattered against Dockety's back.
The windmill rotor stuttered and whined as the string tangled around it
and they were falling,
they were falling,
they were going to crash and all she could think was that
she hoped her father's sketchbook would survive
so her mother would know that they'd found him or almost.

The rotor stuttered to life again.
*Whirr... whirr...*
She smelled burned string and hot metal.
Dockety spiralled down,
spinning faster and faster as the rotor struggled to tear free
of what had tangled it.

At the last possible moment the bot cut the rotor and jerked backward
to land on its feet on the roof of the mayor's house.
They tumbled and twisted and crashed to the cobbles below,
Dockety on bottom with Maddy and Sindy bruised and winded on top of him.

"Oooh..." Maddy groaned.
Everything hurt,
but that meant she was alive.
She opened her eyes and looked up straight into the barrel of the mayor's zap gun.
Half a dozen militia stood on either side of the old wolf,
pikes and axes in hand.

"Well,"
Mayor Lupus said as Maddy struggled to sit up.
"That's quite the entrance."

"Uh huh," Maddy grunted,
too sore for words,
and then,
"Sindy! Sindy, are you aright?"

Her little sister was tugging feebly at the buckles
on the straps that still tied her to Dockety.
"Ow," she whimpered.
"Yeah, I'm aright.
Did we make it?"

"We made it," Maddy said,
pushing Sindy's paws aside to free her
and then pulling her into a hug.
"We're home."

*Sshhzorp... Bzzt... Bzzat-at-at.*
Dockety's speakers crackled,
making the villagers around them jump.
One of the bears raised her ax.

"No! Wait, don't!"
Maddy scrambled to her feet.
"It rescued us.
It's on our side!"

The bear glanced at Mayor Lupus,
her ax still held high.
The mayor patted the air with one hand
but kept her zap gun trained on Dockety's head.
The bot's speakers buzzed and crackled again.
They must have been damaged in the crash,
Maddy realized.

"We were in some kind of underground base,"
she explained.
"There were a whole bunch of bots,
and lots of spare parts and batteries and stuff,
and then we saw them all on a screen.
There's going to be another attack---they're on their way right now!"

A murmur ran in a circle around her.
"In daylight?" someone asked skeptically.
"They never come raiding in daylight."

The mayor nodded.
"Not that I ever heard,
not here or anywhere."

"But we saw them!" Maddy said desperately.
"Same bunch as last time.
And there's a couple of fliers this time,
we saw those too.
And my dad."
She pulled the sketchbook out of her pocket and held it out to the mayor.
"I think he's alive."

"Did you see Santa Claws too?"
a familiar voice mocked.
She spun around to see Bluster and Bravo standing in the door of the mayor's house.
Bravo's ankle was splinted with slats of cedar and layers of canvas,
and he grunted and made a face as he stumped down the stairs,
crutches under his armpits.

"These boys got back a few hours ago,"
the mayor said.
"Had quite a story about how they broke out of the cage
and then had to go back to rescue you and your sister
when you got yourself caught."

Maddy gaped at the mayor.
"Rescue *us*?" she spluttered.
"They didn't rescue us---we rescued them!
And then they took the boat and left us!"

Another murmur ran around the crowd.
"Mm," the mayor said neutrally.
"I figured there might be another version of that story.
No, you hush," she said sharply as Bluster opened his mouth to protest.
"We'll sort of of this out later.
Right now we---ah."

There are times when even a mayor knows it's best not to talk.
A mother pushing through a crowd
to hug the daughters she feared she might never see again
is one of those times.
Mama Roo put her arms around Sindy and Maddy
and squeezed them so tight that Maddy could barely breathe.
She didn't care---she could breathe later.
Just then the familiar warm smell of her mother's fur
was all she needed.

"Don't you ever scare me like that again, either of you,"
Mama Roo said shakily when she finally released them.
She ran a paw over Sindy's head to smooth her rumpled fur.
"I couldn't bear it.
I just couldn't."

"I'm sorry, mama," Sindy said.
"But you shoulda seen it---we were flying!
And Maddy was really brave.
There was this tentacle thing,
and it tried to drag her into the river,
and---"

"Hush now," Maddy said,
bumping her sister with her shoulder.
Their mother looked like she was about to burst into tears.
"Look what we found."

She handed the sketchbook to her mother.
Emotions chased one another across her face:
confusion, shock, dumbstruck wonder,
and then something Maddy hadn't seen in far too long---hope.
"Where did you get this?"
she whispered.

"In this kind of bunker thing.
I'll tell you all about it,
but listen,
you gotta listen,
there's bots coming,
lots of them.
It's the same ones that attacked last night.
You have to believe us,"
she added desperately,
turning back to the mayor.
"They're going to be here any minute!"

The mayor shook her head again.
"Never heard of it, Miz Roo."
She poked Dockety's fallen figure with her toe.
"Maybe if this one could tell us what it saw...?"
Dockety buzzed and crackled.
"Didn't think so," the mayor said glumly.

"We could still take precautions,"
Special Leaf said,
coming through the circle to stand beside Mama Roo.
The ancient tortoise was wearing two sweaters
and had a thick scarf wrapped around his neck.
He looked like he needed crutches more than Bravo did,
but his voice was strong.
"No harm in getting a couple of scouts out, is there?"

The mayor flicked an ear.
"Suppose not," she allowed.
"But we're going to keep an eye on this one 'til this is all straightened out.
You two."
She jerked her chin at a pair of oxen,
one holding a pike and the other resting a heavy hammer on his shoulder.
"Get out along the highway and see what you can see.
And Zeke,
how about you find us some chains and a padlock.
Just a precaution,"
she added as Maddy started to protest.
"Even if this one did help you out,
being bashed around like this can do funny things to a bot's programming,
and I'm not in the mood for taking chances."

Special Leaf put his hand on Maddy's arm.
"That only seems sensible," he said before Maddy could object again.

"I am very glad you're back,"
he continued,
smiling gently.
"I too was afraid we would never see you again.
What you did was very brave."

Maddy glanced at her mother and sister.
"I couldn't have done it without Sindy.
Every time we got stuck,
she managed to push the right button."

"Is that so?"
the special asked thoughtfully.

And then the two oxen came running back into the square yelling,
"Bots! Bots! There's a whole pile of 'em headed this way!"
Even as they spoke a high-pitched whine turned into a drone.
The two fliers Maddy had seen earlier zipped overhead and dropped their canisters.
Thick black dizzysmoke spilled into the square
as a dozen engines rumbled in the distance.
