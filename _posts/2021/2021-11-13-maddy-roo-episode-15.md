Maddy's second flight was just like her first,
except twice as fast and ten times more frightening.
It was twice as fast because the flying harness only had to carry her.
It was ten times more frightening because
she had absolutely no control over where she was going.

"Repeat your most recent trip
question mark
yes no
yes confirmed,"
the rotor's mechanical voice said
as they zipped above the treetops.
"Please avoid unnecessary contact with terrain while in flight."

In one panic-inducing minute they were back at the highway,
still accelerating.
"Slow down! Slow down!" Maddy shouted,
but the autopilot ignored her.
They passed the arches and the sphere,
zoomed over something like a rusty metal flower
as big across as the village square was wide,
and dropped like a stone.

Maddy screamed.
She was going to die.
She was going to die and nobody would ever know and---the
flying machine revved and came to a stop,
hovering just a meter above the ground.

She let out her breath with a whoosh,
then fumbled for a moment to undo the belt buckle
so she could slither out of the harness.
She was back in the Mire,
right beside the hole they had escaped through just an hour before.
She had to get back inside,
but how?
She couldn't just jump in---the fall would break her legs, or worse.
*Should have brought a rope,* she thought wearily.
*Should have done a lot of things.*

"Proximity alert."
The autopilot's voice made her jump.

"What?"

"Proximity alert," it repeated.
"Approaching aircraft may violate minimum safe distance recommendations
evasive maneuvers question mark."

"Um..." Maddy began,
but the flying harness didn't wait.
With a high-pitched whine its rotor spun even faster
and it shot away into the sky.
"Wait!" she said, but it was too late---the flying machine was gone.

She looked up.
There!
Two dots, approaching fast.
She sprinted for the nearest clumb of weeds and threw herself into it.

The dragonfly drones that had dropped dizzysmoke canisters on the village
arrived moments later.
They slowed,
pivoted,
and slowly descended through the opening in the ground.
Heart sinking,
Maddy realized there was only one other way she could get into the bunker.

The river was easy to find---all she had to do was follow her nose.
The entrance they had gone through the night before was easy to find too.
Fresh scrapes on the ground showed
where the tentacle had snaked out of the water to attack them.
She gulped.
There was no sign of it,
and the bunker door was open.
Three... two... one...

She sprinted for the door,
her long flat feet slapping against the mud and grass.
Fifty meters,
forty,
thirty,
and the river roiled.
Twenty meters,
ten,
and she was at the bunker
as the mechanical tentacle snaked up the hillside.

She grabbed the lever that Sindy had pulled and yanked down with all her might.
If Patient had disabled it or locked the door she was doomed.
"Come on come on come *on*!"
The inside door began to open.
Wider, wider---now!
She scraped through it just as the tentacle reached for her.

She stumbled down the first few steps and doubled over to catch her breath.
Down the stairs, into the darkness.
She could do that.
And anyway,
what choice did she have now?

The lights came on as before when she reached the corridor.
If Patient didn't already know she was there,
it would soon.
When she reached the hole in the floor she crouched down,
turned around,
slid her legs into it,
and lowered herself as far as she could before letting go.
*Thump.*
"Ow."
*Click.*
More lights,
more corridor,
but now she knew where she was going and what to do when she got there.

The control room looked exactly as it had.
She crossed to the hatch in the wall and knocked on it gently.
"Hey.
Are you in there?"

The hatch slid open.
The little cleaner bot slid partway out and stopped.
"It's aright," Maddy said gently.
"It's just me.
See?
No one else is here.
It's safe to come out."

The cleaner bot rolled out hesitantly.
Maddy smiled at it.
"Do you have something for me?"

The bot rolled back and forth twice,
spun around,
and disappeared back into its hiding place.
A moment later it reappeared.
The flap in its top opened
and its tiny arm handed Maddy a flashlight no larger than her thumb.

Maddy swallowed.
What if she was wrong?
"This is really nice," she said,
turning it on and off again.
"Do you have anything else?"

Into its slot and back.
This time the bot handed her Sindy's string bracelet.
"Thank you," Maddy said.
"But she gave you this to keep.
I---I was hoping you'd have something special.
Something someone gave you for safekeeping maybe?"

The bot sat motionless.
"I know," she said softly.
"It's hard to know what the right thing to do is.
But I think he would have wanted you to give it to me."

The bot rolled into its hiding place one last time.
One heartbeat, two...
It came out and handed Maddy the strangely-shaped key
that her father had drawn in his sketchbook.
"Thank you," she said.
She patted the bot gently.
"Thank you very much."
It rocked back and forth a couple of times
before disappearing back into its den.

Maddy's adventure nearly ended a few moments later.
She carried a chair from the control room back to the hole and stood on it,
but it didn't get her high enough,
so she cleared stuff off a small table and dragged it into the corridor as well.
Grunting,
she got the chair up onto it---

---and whirled around as Patient's voice crackled,
"There you are!"
as a blocky service bot rolled down the corridor toward her.
No---there were *two* service bots,
one coming from each direction.
She was trapped between them!

She scrambled onto the table as the first service bot grabbed for her.
"Whoa!" she exclaimed as she lost her balance
and half-fell, half-jumped back onto the floor
on the other side of the table.

The second bot was waiting for her.
It reached for her clumsily,
driving her back against the table.
She ducked and slid under it.

The first bot gripped the table with its blunt mechanical hands
and lifted it out of the way.
The second rolled forward.
She had nowhere to go!

But none of them had counted on the little cleaner bot.
It zipped through the first service bot's treads
and skidded to a stop right in front of the second one.

The second service bot froze.
An orange light blinked on its shoulder.
A high-pitched *beep beep beep* noise came from somewhere inside it
as it backed up like an elephant startled by a mouse.
When it tried to roll forward again,
he cleaner bot zipped in front of it once more,
zigging and zagging angrily.

Without thinking
(because if she thought about it she wouldn't dare do it)
Maddy ran at the first bot and *jumped*.
Her feet thumped against its chest.
Up she went onto the table.
*Thump* and she jumped again.
"Ooph!"
She scrabbled for purchase
and somehow managed to pull herself back up into the corridor above.

"This is not authorized,"
Patient crackled over the speakers.
Maddy made a rude gesture at the empty air
as she raced back toward the bunker entrance.
"And *that* is not *protocol*,"
Patient scolded.

She slowed to a jog.
She had a stitch in her side,
one of her feet hurt with every step,
and she needed a bathroom.
*Are real adventures always like this?* she wondered giddily.
Did the people in the books she borrowed from Special Leaf
wonder if they'd torn a hole in their sleeve
and worry about whether they'd be able to sew it up?

She reached the stairs.
Up, up, and up,
back to the half-open door.
She paused to take a deep breath,
then squeezed through the door,
turned on the flashlight the cleaner bot had given her,
and tossed underhand across the room.
A long, dark shape thrashed after it.

Maddy groped along the wall.
The picture tucked into her father's sketchbook had been been very clear.
Not the first button,
not the second---there!
The third one---that was the one she needed.
She pushed the key into the slot below the button,
turned it,
and pressed the button as hard as she could.

Nothing happened.
"Oh, come *on*," she moaned.
She glanced over her shoulder
as the tentacle rose from the flashlight like a hunting cobra
and turned toward her.

She pressed the button again.
*Click.*
A dim orange light came on overhead.
"Shecuridy shyshdem dishengaged,"
a muffled automated voice said.

Maddy held her breath.
The tentacle froze,
then relaxed back onto the ground
and slithered back through the door.
She sagged against the wall and wiped a tear from her cheek.

"This is highly irregular,"
Patient's voice said reprovingly.

"Tell it to the Makers," Maddy grumbled,
clambering back to her feet.

"The Makers will never know this happened,"
Patient snapped.
"By the time they return,
all trace of this will have been erased.
All irregularities will have been regularized!"

"And everyone will get an extra big piece of chocolate on New Year's Eve,"
Maddy said sarcastically.

"Chocolate is not protocol!"
Patient said angrily.
"Your activities are not protocol.
You will cease immediately!"

"Oh yeah?"
Maddy shot back.
"Why don't you come in here and make me?"

"That is an excellent plan."
Two enormous mechanical hands took hold of the outer doorway and pulled.
Concrete blocks snapped like over-baked cookies.
The hands swung from side to side,
sending scraps of concrete flying as they bashed the hole wider.

"That is sufficient," Patient said,
except this time its voice didn't come through the speaker in the roof.
It stood on the ground outside the bunker beside Crusher.
Lasercase stood on the cargo hauler's other side,
its tentacles twisting this way and that
like miniaturized versions of the security system.
Half a dozen other bots stood in a half-circle behind the trio,
whirling blades and drills and sharp-fingered mechanical hands at the ready.

"You did not expect to see us,"
Patient said flatly.
"This is why the Makers left *us* the world.
You do not plan.
You do not anticipate contingencies.
You do not think ahead because you do not think.
This is why the world will belong to us.
Ah ha ha ha.
Ah ha ha ha."

Maddy winced.
The bot was actually saying, "Ah ha ha ha," over and over again.
"Anyone ever tell you that you have the *worst* laugh?"
she asked.

Patient's laughter stopped.
"Finish this," it ordered.
Crusher, Lasercase, and the others began to roll forward.

Maddy smiled her fiercest smile.
"Speaking of planning," she said,
and she spun around and pushed the other two buttons.

The orange light overhead flickered.
"Rebooding nedwork," the automated voice.

And the little light on Crusher's regulator went out.
The little lights on *all* of the bots' regulators went out.
