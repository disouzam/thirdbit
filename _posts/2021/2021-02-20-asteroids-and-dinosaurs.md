Many years ago,
I was working for one of the largest tech companies in the world (at that time, anyway).
One Monday morning our team was called together and told that our project was being shut down.
It came as a shock:
we'd been making steady progress and were close to releasing something
that other divisions in the company said they needed.

My boss had been with the company his entire career;
he knew people who knew people.
After a big of digging he found out that
a couple of vice presidents three levels up from us and three timezones away
had been arm-wrestling for a year.
The one we indirectly reported to had lost,
and the one who had was consolidating his position
by shutting down everything his adversary had started.

I was outraged,
but my boss just shrugged.
"Asteroids happen," he said.
There you are,
happily grazing on palm fronds and thinking about making little dinosaurs
when *wham!*
a cubic kilometer of rock hits the planet and that's all she wrote.
In a small company you can usually tell when something's coming:
you may not know *why* the senior management team is spending all their time in the board room
with the curtains down so that no one else can see what's on the whiteboard,
but you know it's happening.
But in a large company,
or a distributed one,
too much is going on and too much is out of your peripheral vision.
And if you're on the other side of the planet from the point of impact,
you might not even realize what's happened.
All you know is that the sky has gone dark and summer is long overdue.

I'm less outraged now than I was then.
I grew up thinking that the dinosaurs had been failures because they went extinct,
but they lasted about 165 million years
and their descendents are still flying around all over the world.
That long-ago project didn't ship,
but bits and pieces of what we built cropped up later
in other things that members of our team were reassigned to.
And without that great big *wham!* 65 million years ago,
my distant ancestors wouldn't have had a bunch of empty ecological niches to expand into.
Having a cubic kilometer of rock make a crater in your world is always going to be a bit of a shock,
but after the dust settles,
it's better to think about how much there was and what came after
than about how unexpectedly it all ended.
