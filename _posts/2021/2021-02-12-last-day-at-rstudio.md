Today was my last day at RStudio.
I'm sad to leave,
but grateful to everyone in the R community who made me feel welcome.
I don't know what comes next---the company is being generous about redundancy pay,
so I have a few weeks to figure it out---but I think I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks
polished *[Software Tools in JavaScript](https://stjs.tech/)*,
trying to get another short story out the door,
and working on some guitar chords.
If you're hiring,
I'd enjoy hearing from you.
