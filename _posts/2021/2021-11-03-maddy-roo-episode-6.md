Maddy screamed.
Afterward,
she wished it had been a proper battle cry,
like a wolf's howl or a lion's roar,
but it was just a normal everyday terrified scream.

She dropped the stone Dockety had given her and flailed her arms.
"Ooph!"
She landed on the roof of the cage cart,
slid forward with another scream,
and somehow managed to get a grip on its bars.
Her legs swung to the side and dangled over the highway.

"Maddy! Maddy! I'm here! I'm here!"
Her sister scrambled to her feet,
a goat on either side of her shouting words
that the wind snatched away before Maddy could hear them.

"Hang on!"
Maddy shouted down at the three captives.
"We're going to get you out of there!"

Dockety raced forward and body-checked another raider bot
as it ratcheted up on its wheeled legs and tried to grab Maddy.
The young roo pulled her legs under her,
ignoring the pain of the metal bars bashing against her shins
every time the cart hit a bump.
She could see the lock on the cage door,
but how was she going to break it open without her rock?

And then the cargo bot hauling the cage realized she was there.
Its massive square head turned all the way around like an owl's.
"Error,"
it pronounced in a scraping gravelly voice.

"Error yourself!"
Maddy shouted at it defiantly.
Without giving herself time to be frightened
she slid forward over the roof of the cage,
swung around,
and lowered herself onto the narrow triangular hitch
that connected it to the bot.

"Be careful!" Sindy pleaded
as Maddy crouched down and leaned forward.
Almost...
Almost...
No.
She couldn't reach the linchpin that held the hitch in place
without letting go of the cage.

"Maddy, don't!"
She ignored her sister's frightened cry and lunged forward.
Got it!
Holding onto the hitch with one paw,
she yanked the linchpin out with the other and threw it away.

She thought the cargo bot would just pull away smoothly
to leave the unhitched cage cart rolling along the highway behind it.
That didn't happen.
Instead,
there a loud crash
as Dockety and a raider bot slammed into the side of the cage,
their manipulators grappling for holds on each other.

Maddy screamed for a third time as the cart careened off the road.
A wheel bumped over a stone,
throwing Maddy off the hitch and into a scratchy patch of brambles.
The trio inside the cart screamed in their turn as it tipped over on its side
and slid down the rocky slope toward the swamp.
Maddy scrambled to her feet and ran after it.

The cart slid to a halt just a few paces from the edge of the muck.
Rusty scraps of old machinery lay all around.
Maddy grabbed one end of a metal bar and pulled with all her might.
The bar came free of the mud with a disgusting *shlurp*.

She ran over to the cart.
Luckily,
it had landed door side up.
She tossed her bar on top of it,
scrambled up,
wedged the end of the bar in by the lock,
and leaned her whole weight against it.
*Pank!*
The lock burst open.

"Give me your paw!" she ordered.

Her sister stretched on tiptoe.
"I can't reach!
Hey!"
One of the goats lifted her up so that Maddy could grab her wrist,
then reached up himself.

A few moments later the four of them were standing beside the cage.
Maddy had her arms wrapped around her sister.
"I was so afraid," she whispered in Sindy's ear.
"I was so afraid I'd never see you again."

Sindy sniffled.
"Me too."

"Well ain't this sweet," one of the goats muttered.
Maddy straightened up.
She knew that voice---it was Bluster,
which meant the other goat must be his brother Bravo.
Of all the people she would have wanted to rescue,
they were the last.

"Well don't be too hasty thanking me,"
she said coldly.

"We would've been aright,"
Bluster said defensively.
"Wouldn't we?"
He nudged his brother,
who glanced at Maddy apologetically but didn't say anything.

Sindy took her sister's paw.
"Was that a bot helping you?" she asked.

"Don't worry about that now,"
Maddy said.
"We have to get out of here!"

"And go where?"
Bluster demanded.
"In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in the middle of the Mire."

"Yeah, but at least you're not in a cage any more.
Oh, and you're welcome,"
Maddy added sarcastically.
The goat glowered at her but didn't reply.

"What are we going to do, Maddy?" Sindy asked.
"We can't---ulp!"

Maddy covered Sindy's mouth with her paw
as the cargo bot appeared at the top of the slope.
"Don't move!" she hissed at the goats.

The cargo bot's square head pivoted from side to side as it searched for them.
Maddy held her breath.
Could it keep its balance on the loose gravel?
Maybe if it came after them it would topple over.

*And then we'd only have all the other bots to deal with,*
she finished in her head.
She wished she knew where Dockety was.
She hoped it was aright.

A long moment passed.
The cargo bot backed up and rumbled away to look for them elsewhere.
Maddy let out her breath with a whoosh.
"Come on," she ordered the others.

"Where?" Bluster demanded.

Maddy gave him a cold look.
"Anywhere that isn't here.
But if you want to stay put, go ahead.
Come on, Sindy."
She took her sister's paw and started walking.
A moment later the goat twins followed them.

*Shlurp shlurp shlurp...*
At first Maddy tried to pick her way from rock to rock,
but her feet were soaked and muddy after just a few steps
so she gave up and just trudged in as straight a line as she could,
which wasn't very straight.
The river was wide and shallow in the Mire,
and any three people would have had four different opinions
about where its bank actually was,
or whether even it had one.
The smell of damp vegetation was almost overpowering.
A sharp chemical tang came and went,
reminding Maddy of the turpentine she used to clean her paintbrushes
or the greasy black poison her mother sponged onto the porch every spring
to keep the termites away.
If they got back to Rusty Bridge,
she was going to take the longest, soapiest bath of her entire life.

They stopped twice when they heard motors revving in the distance,
crouching behind whatever bushes were nearby until the sound faded.
After a few minutes they reached a stand of trees,
fingerling willows no taller than Maddy
and then larger ones whose branches bent in elegant sad arcs.
Some of their leaves shimmered metallically,
tinkling faintly in the breeze.
The foursome steered clear of those ones.

They had been walking for about half an hour
when a patch of bark slipped off a fallen tree
as Bravo was clambering over it.
His foot slid out from under him.
"Whoa!"
His legs went one way and his body went the other.
He landed awkwardly on the tree and rolled off onto the ground.

"Y'aright?" his brother asked,
helping him up.

Bravo shook him off,
then swore as he tried to take a step.
"My ankle," he grunted.
"I think I twisted it."

"Idiot."
Bluster punched him in the shoulder.
"Why'd you go and do that?"
Bravo punched him back, harder.

"Stop that!" Maddy snapped.
"Let me have a look at it."

"Oh, so you're a doctor now?"
Bluster said sarcastically.
"Know-it-all."

"She knows a bucket more'n you," Sindy said loyally.
"And she's quieter too," she added pointedly as Bluster opened his mouth.

Maddy straightened up.
"I don't think it's sprained," she told Bravo.
"Just do the best you can, aright?"
The goat nodded.

They went more slowly after that.
Bravo leaned on Bluster and Sindy needed rest more and more frequently.
Maddy had to bite her tongue to stop herself from telling them all to hurry up.
It would take them days to get back to Rusty Bridge at this speed,
but there was nothing she could do about it
except hope that Gumption had convinced the mayor
to send people to rescue them.

A particularly squelchy patch of land
sent them in a wide arc that brought them nearer the highway than Maddy liked.
*Just 'til we're past that tall tree,*
she promised herself.

As if it had heard her thoughts,
the tree took a long stride toward them.
A blinding-bright searchlight picked them out of the darkness,
and a familiar harsh mechanical horn blared.
It was the long-legged bot from the raid on Rusty Bridge,
and it had spotted them!

"Back to the river!" she yelled.
The muddy ground was their only hope---the long-legged bot would sink
if it tried to follow them.

"Maddy!" her sister shrieked.
Drawn by the horn and the searchlight,
another bot was grinding toward them on treads,
revving an oversized chainsaw on the end of one arm.

"There's another one on the river!" Bluster shouted
with panic in his voice
as the searchlight swept across something
that looked like a flatboat with a bucket for a head.
It was an ambush,
Maddy realized,
and now they were caught with nowhere to run
as the three bots closed in.

"Head for those trees!" she yelled, pointing.
They wouldn't stop the bots,
or even slow them down for more than a few seconds,
but it was all she could think of.

*Zzzrrr!*
The sawbot waved its whizzing arm at them,
trying to drive them back into the open.
Bravo pulled a clump of mud out of the ground and threw it at the bot.
It splatted uselessly on its rust-stained torso.

*Zzzrrr!*
The chainsaw swung again as the long-legged bot with the searchlight
tried to grab Sindy with one of its elongated arms.
"Get away!" she shouted angrily,
scooping up some mud of her own to throw.

*Splat!*
The mud hit the searchlight,
throwing them briefly back into darkness.

*Zzzrrrmmm!*
The chainsaw bot's arm hit a branch of one of the willow trees.

*Snap!*
The branch fell to the ground
right where the long-legged bot was taking its next step.
It staggered drunkenly,
windmilling its arms just a person as it tried to regain its balance.

*Shlurp!*
One of its feet landed in a muddy sinkhole.
Its horn blared as it toppled over
and fell on the boatbot's head
with a sound like an empty can being crunched underfoot.

"Go!" Maddy shouted.
"Into the boat!"

The goats didn't need to be told twice.
Bluster pelted across the mud and threw himself onto the boat
as the long-legged bot rolled off it into the river.
"Come on!" he yelled at his twin brother
as Bravo ran-hopped, ran-hopped, and grabbed Bluster's outstretched paw.

But Maddy and Sindy were too slow.
The chainsaw bot blocked their way,
its arm whizzing angrily.

And then something rocketed out of nowhere,
bounced into the air,
and slammed into the sawbot at just the right spot.
The sawbot tipped and tilted and fell on its side,
its heavy treads throwing mud and muck into the air
as it tried vainly to right itself.

"Dockety!" Maddy exclaimed.

Their rescuer got back to its feet.
"Are you intact?" it asked
as it scraped mud off its wheel
and flicked it onto the sawbot.

"We're fine.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!"

"But Maddy---the boat!
They're taking the boat!"
Sindy pulled on her sleeve.

Maddy spun around.
Her heart sank.
The two goats were drifting away on the current.

"Come back!" she yelled.
"Please! Come back!"

"I don't know how!"
Bravo shouted through cupped paws.
"But we'll get help!"

Moments later they vanished into the night,
leaving the two young roos alone in the Mire
with a dented bot for company
and no idea how to get home.
