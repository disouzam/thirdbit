"They have my *daughter*!
We *have* to go after them!"
Mama Roo shouted.
Maddy had never imagined that her mother could be so fierce,
but in that moment she looked like she could frighten a tiger.

The mayor shook her head.
"I'm sorry, Cedilia, you know I am.
Nope, nope, just let me speak."
She held up her zap gun,
turning it to show the now-dark indicator bar on its side.
"See that?
There's nothing left.
It'll take a couple of days at least to get it back to full charge,
and even then,
we've only got the one."
She scowled.
"Not that it was much use against that crab thing."

"And what about Special Leaf?"
Mayor Lupus continued as Mama Roo opened her mouth again,
gesturing at the porch steps
where the old tortoise was sitting,
his eyes closed
and the wrinkles on his dark green face even deeper than usual.
"He's about ready to fall over.
Even if we could catch up with 'em,
we wouldn't have a chance."

Mama Roo's arm tightened around Maddy's shoulders.
"We can't just let her go," Mama Roo said hopelessly.
"Lupus, I can't lose her too."

The old wolf sighed.
"I am truly sorry, Cedilia.
I'll come by later to look in on you.
Right now I have to find out who those two goats were that they grabbed,
and then start figuring out how they managed to sneak up on us like that."

"It was the twins,"
Special Leaf said,
opening his eyes.
He struggled to his feet,
holding the steps' wooden banister to steady himself,
and waved off the mayor as she came over to help.
"The one that had legs like a stork chased them right into the arms of
the big one hauling the cage.
I tried to trip it up, but..."
He shook his head.
"I'm sorry.
I just don't have the strength I used to."

"You looked plenty strong to me,"
the mayor said firmly,
clapping him on the shoulder.
"The way you were throwing all those rocks at 'em?
Looked like a damn avalanche.
Never seen anything like it."

"I didn't do that," Special Leaf protested,
but the mayor had already turned away
to start barking orders at the militia.
Salvage the scraps of armor that had been knocked off the bots during the fight.
Pick up anyone who was still unconscious and get them indoors.
And someone---no, not just one person, best it be two together---get across to the Gruff family farm
and let them know their boys had been taken.

"I should go with them," Gumption said awkwardly.
"They're my cousins,
and my mama will be worrying about me.
I'm really sorry about Sindy."

Maddy nodded,
not trusting herself to speak.
If she had run away when her mother told her too,
or if she had somehow *made* the mayor believe that the ambush was coming,
her sister would still be with them.
If only the bot they had warned them had come with them to warn everyone else.

She froze.
The bot!
"Gumption---the bot!
The one from the river---it'll know where they're going.
We gotta find it!"

The goat's eyes widened.
He nodded.
"We should, uh, go help folk clean up," he said loudly.

"Good idea," Maddy replied, raising her voice.
"Mama, Gumption and I are gonna..."
She gestured at the mess in the square,
not finishing her sentence so as not to actually lie.

Her mother nodded,
the grief on her face making her look older than the tortoise.
"Thank you, Maddy,"
she said, her voice somehow steady.
"Special, let me see you back to yours."

Maddy and Gumption picked up an armload of cobblestones each
and added them to the pile that the Ox brothers had already started.
"We'll get those ones," Maddy said,
pointing at the stones furthest from the pile.
The nearest ox grunted,
not really listening.

The two teenagers fetched the stones Maddy had pointed at
and then,
with only a glance at each other,
walked back as if to pick up some more and just kept walking.
It was a tactic they had used more than once
to get out of picking potatoes.
As long as they acted
as if they were doing something they were supposed to be doing,
grownups would mostly not pay them any attention.

Two minutes later they were in the small square
where the black recharging pillar stood.
"Y'all should be home,"
a passing bear said.

"Yessir, headed that way," Gumption replied obediently.
He waited until the bear was out of earshot before whispering,
"So where do we start?"

"I dunno,"
Maddy said despairingly.
The recharging pillar was the only place she could think the bot might go.
Tears welled up in her eyes.
She wiped them angrily on her sleeve.
"This is hopeless.
I'm never going to see Sindy again."

Gumption patted her shoulder awkwardly.
"Don't say that.
Maybe it went to the other one.
It's not that far.
I---I could walk with you if you want."
Maddy sniffled,
nodded,
and fell into step beside him.

Once upon a time
the river had been wider and deeper,
and the Makers' road had run along its bank.
But many years had passed since then,
and the river's course had changed many times.
Where once the river and the road had bent in long parallel arcs,
now the road ran through a forest
with its former companion just a soft sound in the distance.

Another black glass recharging pillar stood guard
where that arc in the road bent back toward the river.
Only grass and moss and a few brave flowers grew near it.

Maddy kicked a pebble at the post angrily.
"This is *hopeless*," she repeated.

"Wait!"
Gumption pointed at the soft ground near the pillar.
In the failing evening light it took Maddy a moment to see what he had spotted,
but then her heart leaped.
A single tire track ran up to the post and then away into the trees.
They hurried over to take a closer look.
The cross-hatched treadmarks were still fresh.

"It must have come here," Gumption said.

"Yeah, or one of the raiders needed a recharge."
Maddy shivered.
The last of the day's warmth was gone,
and the forest around them looked more ominous with each darkening moment.
They were a long way from the village
and no one would know where to look for them.
She opened her mouth to say,
"Maybe we should go back,"
but what came out instead was,
"Ulp,"
as the bot they were looking for stepped out of the trees,
a cobblestone in each of its mechanical hands.

The kangaroo and the goat looked at the bot.
The bot looked back.
Somewhere nearby a bird called and another answered.

"Oh, this is silly,"
Maddy snapped.
"If you're going to throw those at us, just throw them."

The bot hesitated and then lowered the rocks
(but did not, Maddy noted, actually drop them).
"This will not attack if those do not."

Maddy glanced over her shoulder,
wondering what "those" were,
then realized the bot meant her and Gumption.
"Well, we won't unless you do."
She nodded at the black pillar.
"Did we scare you off recharging?"

"This was merely being cautious,"
the bot replied primly.
"This needs to be fully charged to help its *click*."

The bot's lenses rotated.
"To help its *click*."
Its lenses rotated again.
"Interesting.
This appears to be unable to recall the word
it wishes to use to describe the modified Model GX-470 cargo hauler."

"The big bot?
The one that was hauling the cart?"
Maddy asked.

"Correct."
The bot shook its head left-right-left-right so quickly that it practically vibrated.
"The modified GX-470 is this one's most important---
most important---
most imp---"
It shook its head again.
"Error. Error. Error."

"Well,
that's the one that's got my sister and the others,
so if you'll help us,
maybe we can help you."
Maddy had no idea *how* they could help,
but if she had learned anything from bargaining with her mother over chores,
it was not to be too specific too early.

The bot's lenses rotated.
"You propose a joint rescue mission?"
It thought for a microsecond.
"That would significantly improve the odds of success.
This one agrees."
It stuck out its three-fingered manipulator.

"Um..." Gumption started,
but Maddy stepped forward and took the bot's hand.
If there was any chance at all of getting Sindy back,
she had no other choice.

"So what should I call you?"
she asked,
taking her paw back and massaging her new bruises.

"This one's serial number is Dockety-One Forty-Bee,"
the bot replied.
"But my *click*---
my *click*---
the modified GX-470 refers to this one as Dockety."

"All right, Dockety---do you know where they're headed?"

"Lasercase will take the most efficient route back to base.
That is the highway through the contaminated zone.
We must depart immediately if we are to intercept them."

"Who's Lasertaste?"
Gumption interrupted.

"Laser *case*," Dockety corrected.
"It leads the substitute worker acquisition team.
This one feels strong antipathy toward it,"
the bot added.

"Was it the one with the tentacles?"
Maddy asked with a sinking feeling.

"Affirmative.
It controls our regulators
when we are out of range of our base."
The claws on its heavy manipulator snapped together,
making the two children jump.
"This one feels strong antipathy toward regulators as well."

"I bet."
Maddy took a deep breath.
"All right.
How do we catch up with them?"

"We cannot," Dockety said.
"Not unless you allow me to carry you."

"Um..." Gumption started again,
but Maddy shushed him.
"Can you carry both of us?"

Dockety thought for another microsecond.
"Not at sufficient speed.
Or with sufficient safety."

Sometimes you have choices.
Other times it feels like you have no more choice about what you do next
than a rock has about whether or not to fall when it's been thrown.
Maddy hugged Gumption,
a real strong hug that she hoped said all the things
she hadn't found the courage to say
for the past few weeks
every time they'd been alone together.
"Go tell my mama," she said in his ear.
"And you tell her I'm coming back, all right?
Because I am."

She released him and turned to the bot.
"Let's go," she said,
and while Gumption was still gaping at them
Dockety picked her up,
dropped its wheel onto the ground,
and roared back up the path to the old highway.

"Whoa!" Maddy exclaimed,
but Dockety didn't slow down.
It was the fastest she had ever gone---faster even than
the time Pelter the horse from Three Posts had given them all rides at the fair.
She closed her eyes,
but that just made it worse,
so she opened them,
which made it even worser.

"Where's this base of yours?" she belated asked,
half-shouting to be heard over wind of their passage
and the bot's roaring motor
and the rattles coming from inside its torso
that she really hoped were normal.

"Approximately half the distance between here and Heck,"
Dockety replied.
"We will be able to go much faster once we're on the highway."

Sure enough,
a few moments later the path rejoined the highway and the bot sped up.
The ancient black surface beneath them was cracked in places,
and Dockety had to swerve around fallen branches
and the few clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the road,
but for the first time in her life Maddy felt her fur
actually blown back by speed.
"Woo hoo!" she whooped.
It was too big to be afraid of.

Without warning a pair of thin green lines of light lanced out
from either side of Dockety's eyes.
The bot's head began snapping from side to side,
left-right-left-right,
sweeping the lasers across the pavement
to trace a picture of its bumps and cracks in the darkness.
It reminded Maddy of the rubbings her father used to make
by putting a piece of paper over something
and going back and forth over it with a pencil
to bring out the shape underneath.

As the last dregs of daylight drained away and the stars came out
they passed under a line of ruined arches
that stretched from one horizon to the other.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called "the thing".
Maddy had heard about all of them from travelers
and by eavesdropping on the militia patrols
that the mayor occasionally sent along the highway
to see whether trouble was brewing.
She had dreamed of seeing them herself,
and of painting them,
but she had never imagined it would happen like this.

The ground around them grew damp as they raced along,
and the smell of rotting vegetation and rust made Maddy wrinkle her nose.
They were entering the Mire,
the great trackless swamp that separated the bot city of Heck
from the forests and farms where Maddy had grown up.
The Makers' highway was the only safe route through it,
and even there travelers were careful to eat and drink
only what they brought with them.

"Target acquired," Dockety buzzed.
There in front of them was the convoy:
half a dozen bots,
no two alike,
and in their midst the big cargo hauler and the cage cart.

Maddy counted quickly.
"Where are the others?" Maddy asked,
shouting once more to be heard.

"This does not know."
Dockety hesitated.
"That is worrying."

Without slowing down it veered over to the side of the highway
to scoop up one rock and then another.
"Take this," it ordered,
handing her one of the rocks.
"Get on the cage.
Climb forward, then get on the one pulling the cart and disable its regular.
Forcefully,"
it added.

"What!?"
Maddy exclaimed.
"Do you have a short circuit or something?"

"Several,"
Dockety said.
"But that does not mean it is not a good plan."

Closer, closer---a periscope popped up out of the head
of the bot at the tail of the convoy and twisted around to point at them.
Dockety put on sudden burst of speed.
As it raced past the bot with the periscope
Dockety tossed its rock at the other bot's wheels.
*Bang! Crash!*
The bot with the periscope tumbled through the air,
knocking another off balance.
With no more warning than that,
Dockety hurled Maddy into the air.
