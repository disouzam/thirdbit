Maddy was trying to sketch the willow tree in the center of the village square
when Gumption showed up with a couple of books under his arm.
She hadn't exactly snuck out of the house,
but she hadn't told her mama she was leaving either.
Besides,
she had spent the whole morning and most of the afternoon doing chores,
mostly to avoid having to look after her little sister,
so she felt she'd earned some time for herself.
Plus,
yesterday had been laundry day,
so she could sit there in the checked green skirt her mama had cut down for her---the one that *didn't*
have work stains on it yet.

"Heya," Gumption said breathlessly as he plopped himself down on the gray stone bench beside her.
"How's it going?"

"Aright," she said without looking up.
The willow tree had defeated her once before.
She was determined to capture its drooping green branches in her notebook,
but somehow the lines she drew didn't quite capture their melancholy curves
the way the pictures in Special Leaf's books did.

She closed her sketchbook with a sigh.
Gumption had a fresh food stain on his shirt, she noticed,
and if he had combed his brown-and-white fur that morning,
someone or something had carefully uncombed it since.
She nodded at the small pile of books he had set down between them.
"What did you think?"

The goat boy shrugged.
"They were aright. A lot of...you know."
He rolled his eyes in a way that meant
"too much romance, not enough last-second escapes from villainous bots".

"Yeah," Maddy agreed.
She stood up and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the worn blue canvas satchel her father had made for her.
"Come on---let's see if he has anything new."

Once upon a time,
the village of Rusty Bridge had been nothing more than
a rectangle of two-story buildings around a central square
where travellers could park their wagons overnight.
All of the buildings' windows had faced the square:
the outer walls had been blank and double-thick
to keep their occupants safe against rogue bots and roving bandits.

Over the years,
though,
more houses had sprouted around that rectangle:
smaller,
less well-ordered,
and built for comfort rather than defense.
One of these belonged to Special Leaf,
the only tortoise within a hundred kays and the village's oldest resident by far.

Maddy would never forget the first time her mother and father took her to the special's house.
"Don't be afraid," they comforted her,
not realizing that she hadn't been until they said that.
But when Special Leaf opened his front door and smiled at them
she saw the books stacked on his shelves
and her nervousness vanished.

"Are they *real*?" she asked in wonder.

The old tortoise chuckled.
Like all reptile people he was completely bald,
but his smile was as warm as a freshly-baked biscuit.
"As real as you are."
He ushered her in
and handed her a tattered old picture book
that just happened to be lying on his battered old rocking chair.
"Would you like to borrow this one?
There are lots of others."
She walked out of the house with an armload of books and stars in her eyes,
then sat down on his porch and started to read the first one
while her parents vainly tried to persuade the old tortoise to take a jar of home-made jam as a thank-you.

Gumption had started coming by a few months later.
His family hadn't brought him---the village goats weren't bookish people---and
at first Maddy had resented him intruding into her magical world of stories and long-ago science.
But they started talking one day about the relative merits of mysteries versus adventures
and they hadn't stopped since.
Now they swapped their borrowed books back and forth
so that they at least had someone to roll their eyes with over the mushy bits.

Special Leaf's house smelled like paper and old sweaters and fresh cabbage---sometimes
if Maddy closed her eyes she could almost imagine that her father was there with her.
The old tortoise was snoring in his rocking chair when they arrived,
so they placed their books quietly on the table beside him
and picked two more each from the shelves.
Maddy glowered at Gumption when he pointed at the top shelf
the special said they weren't old enough to read yet.
"Kidding," he mouthed silently.
Maddy swished her tail in annoyance and shooed him outside.

Her heart sank as soon as she stepped through the door.
Her sister Sindy was sitting on the porch
in an embroidered overall that had once been Maddy's,
tangling and untangling a piece of string around her fingers.
"Where did you *go*?" she asked,
bouncing to her feet.
"Mama said I could play with you but you weren't *there*!
Heya, Gumption!"
she finished brightly.

"Heya," Gumption grunted,
very carefully *not* looking at Maddy.

"Does mama know you're here?" Maddy demanded.

Sindy bounced up and down a couple of times.
"Not exactly," she admitted.
"But she said I could play with you and you weren't home
so the only way I could do that was to come and find you
and I figured this would be the best place to look and---"

"Stop!" Maddy snapped.
"We're both gonna be in trouble if mama thinks I let you wander off.
Let's just go home and hope she doesn't notice."

Sindy's face fell,
and if she'd had proper ears like her sister and Gumption they would have drooped.
"But I'm *bored*," she said plaintively.

"You're always bored," Maddy muttered under her breath.
As she fumbled with the tie string on her satchel
her books slipped out from under her arm and thudded onto the porch.

She sighed heavily.
"Now look what you made me do.
No, it's aright, I've got them."
She shooed Gumption away,
brushed off the books,
and tucked them back into her bag.
"Come on, you."

The trio walked back to the village square without speaking.
A few grownups nodded or said hello as they passed.
Maddy nodded back,
but was too busy being annoyed to do any more than that.
It had been two years since the bots had taken her father.
She had helped her mother every day since then:
cleaning the house,
mixing paint for portraits and signs,
and most of all,
looking after her little sister.
Every time Mama Roo said, "I'm sorry you've had to grow up so fast,"
Maddy told her she didn't mind,
and she *didn't*,
she really didn't,
but the one afternoon each week when she got to practice sketching
and talk about books with Gumption was special,
and it wasn't fair of Sindy to---

"Hey," Gumption said, elbowing her.
Maddy blinked.
They had passed through the houses on the other side of the square
and reached the smaller square that people *didn't* pass time in.
An ageless black glass pillar stood in its center,
half again the height of anyone Maddy knew
and as big around as a rain barrel.
The few friendly bots who came through Rusty Bridge used it for recharging.
Moss didn't grow on it
and birds never landed on it.
Gumption said his uncle had touched it once on a dare
and got a shock so strong it made his whole arm tingle.
Maddy had never tried to sketch it---whenever she walked past,
it felt like something or someone was watching her,
and even if she knew how to capture that in a drawing,
she didn't want to.

The pillar wasn't the only thing in the square, though.
Bluster and Bravo Gruff were sitting on the unfinished brick wall
that surrounded the pillar
pitching pebbles at it with their usual sullen expressions on their faces.
They were a head taller than Gumption,
and the nubs of their horns had just started to show through their fur.

For a moment Maddy thought they would be able to hurry by without any trouble,
but then Bluster nudged his twin brother.
Maddy took her sister's misshapen paw in her own.
"You just stay hushed," she cautioned quietly,
squeezing to show she meant it.
She hitched her satchel up onto her shoulder with her other paw
and tried to ignore the dryness in her mouth.

"Heya, roo," Bluster drawled as he and his brother sauntered over.
"Whatcha got in yer pouch?"

"Books," Maddy said curtly.
"And it's not a pouch, it's a satchel."

"I wasn't asking about your *satchel*," Bluster said,
stepping into her path.
"I was asking about your *pouch*."
He rubbed his belly and grinned wickedly.
"Gummy put anything in there yet?"

"Oh!" Sindy said.
"You're *disgusting*!"

Bluster spat on the cobblestones.
"Wasn't talkin' to you, throwback."

Maddy felt her sister stiffen.
Most children looked like their parents---goats had goats,
crocs had crocs,
and if the parents were different,
their children would take after one or the other.
Every once in a while,
though,
someone like Sindy was born.
No tail, no scales,
no fur except for a wiry black tuft on the top of her head
that defeated all but the most stubborn combing,
and useless little claws on the ends of her skinny fingers.
Adults were careful not to feel sorry for her in public,
but other children weren't always as nice,
and children like Bluster and Bravo *never* were.

Her heart sank as Gumption stepped in front of her.
"Why don't you eat glue?" he told his cousin hotly,
his paws balling into fists.

"Why don't you make me?" Bluster replied,
mocking and menacing at the same time.

"Yeah, make us,"
his brother Bravo echoed,
cracking his knuckles.

"I don't think glue would be a good diet for any of us, do you?"
Special Leaf asked calmly.
Maddy jumped.
Somehow the old tortoise had come up behind them without anyone noticing.
He looked as peaceful as a log floating down river
with his little round glasses perched on his nose,
but the goat brothers unclenched their paws.

The special held a sheet of paper out to Maddy.
"I think you dropped this."

"Thanks," Maddy said.
She squeezed Sindy's paw before letting go of it
to take back the sketch she had left behind.

"You're getting much better,"
the tortoise continued.
"Your father would be very proud of you."

"Thanks," Maddy repeated.

The silence that followed stretched and stretched until finally Bluster broke it.
"C'mon," he said to his brother,
a surly look on his face.
With the barest of nods to the special they walked away,
in step as always.

"They're *stinkers*," Sindy pronounced, wrinkling her nose.

Maddy let out a relieved breath.
"Yes they are. Thank you," she told the special a third time.

The tortoise smiled.
"You're welcome---it would have been a shame to lose such a nice drawing.
Are you headed home?
It's been a while since I saw your mother,
and I could use the walk."

The Roo family's house stood on the very edge of the village,
neatly painted a pale orange that made it look warm on even the coldest days.
The ground floor had been built by a rhino
who had dreamed of opening a tavern in Rusty Bridge,
only to discover that there wasn't enough traffic on the ancient highway
to keep one going.
A family of wolves had added a second story after he moved on,
its hallway and three bedrooms built on a smaller scale.
Papa Roo had taken one look and decided it was the perfect place to start a family.
Mama Roo had rolled her eyes and reminded him that
he'd called the previous three towns they had visited perfect too.
He had laughed and said,
"Yeah, but this time I'm right."

Maddy had heard that story almost every night when she was little.
She remembered it each time she opened the bigger-than-usual front door
and entered the house's larger-than-most-people front hall.
"Mama!" she called.
"We're home!
And the special's come with!"

Mama Roo poked her head out of the kitchen.
"Heya, special. Heya, Gumption."

"Ma'am." "Heya, Mama Roo." they answered
as Sindy bounced down the hallway for a hug.

"Careful," Mama Roo cautioned her youngest.
"I've got paint on me."

"Don't care,"
Sindy said,
her voice muffled by her mother's fur and apron.

Mama Roo smiled down at her and scratched her daughter's ears.
"I was just about to make some soup," she said.
"Will you stay?"

"That's very kind, but I'm afraid I have a prior engagement,"
Special Leaf replied politely.
"Though I would take tea if you had some?"

"Of course.
What about you, Gumption?"

The young goat cleared his throat.
"Thanks, Mama Roo, but I oughta get home."

"Some other time, then," Mama Roo said brightly,
careful to keep the relief out of her voice.
There wasn't much call for sign painting and portraiture in Rusty Bridge.
Between people paying just a little more than they needed to
and the mending and housecleaning Mama Roo took on
the family was managing to get by,
but Maddy knew that dinner for two extra people tonight
would have meant no lunch for her mother the next day.
Mama Roo would have insisted if it was almost anyone else---she
was as proud as a lion when it came to keeping house---but
Gumption was practically almost family
and somehow Special Leaf always made people feel comfortable
when no one else could.

"Can I walk Gumption home?"
Maddy asked her mother as casually as she could.
"We haven't hardly had a chance to talk."

"Of course,
but you be home before dark."

Sindy sniffled and pulled her face out of her mother's apron.
"I want to come too!"

"I don't see why---um."
Mama Roo stopped herself at a pleading glance from her older daughter.
"Actually,
Sindy,
I think I'd like you to set the table.
No, don't fuss, it needs doing---you hop to it.
Now,
where *is* that rosehip tea..."

The sun was low on the horizon
as Maddy and Gumption walked slowly back toward the village.
By unspoken agreement they left the main road
and took the path that ran down by the river.
It was the longer route,
but that was aright.
For one heart-stopping moment Maddy thought Gumption was going to hold her paw.
When he didn't she almost took his,
but then they came out of the trees onto the riverbank and the moment was behind them.

It had rained heavily over the last two days,
leaving the path damp and squelchy under their feet.
The river was higher and faster than it had been during the summer
when they had come down here with their other friends to splash and swim and avoid chores.
"So if you could have been anything, what would you have wanted to be?"
Gumption asked out of nowhere.
He didn't have to say "any kind of special".
Like every child in Rusty Bridge---in the whole world, probably---they
had both hoped they would start to develop a special power
as their teenage changes came on.
It hadn't happened,
but as Gumption had observed more than once,
at least Bluster and Bravo hadn't gotten any either.

"I'd want to be a mover," Maddy replied,
relieved to have something to talk about.
"Like Special Leaf, but for little things,
so I could draw while I was eating."

"You do that anyway," Gumption observed.

"Do not," Maddy protested.

Gumption bumped her hip with his.
"Do too," he said with a lopsided grin.
"Remember the time you---hey, look down there!"
He pointed at the river.

Maddy gasped.
Salvage!
And not just a few scraps either,
but a couple of what looked like solar panels
and some machinery
and---
"Wait, what are you doing?
Gumption, get back here!"

"Finders keepers!" the young goat called over his shoulder.
"Come on!"

Maddy only hesitated for a moment.
Most of what washed down the river through the Mire from Heck was scrap,
but even scrap could be sold for blacksmithing.
And tech like those solar panels---just one of those
would fetch enough to feed her family for a month.
Her family and Gumption's,
she corrected guiltily in her head
as she scrambled down the riverbank,
loose gravel skittering away under her feet.

The solar panels had snagged on a knot of branches
that were themselves caught in the weeds upstream from a sandbar.
She and Gumption waded into the river,
heedless of the cold water that rose almost to their knees.
At first they tried to lift one of the panels,
but everything was too tangled together.
Pushing and shoving,
they managed to work it free and slide it up onto the sandbar.
It was lighter than Maddy had expected,
but its edges were as sharp as broken glass.

She and Gumption stood side by side for a moment to catch their breath.
"What do you think it is?" he asked,
jerking his chin at the mess of rods and flywheels
that lay in the water.

Maddy shook her head.
"Just junk, maybe?"
She glanced sideways at him.
"I think we ought to leave it.
For the grownups to get," she added hastily.
"We can get the other panel,
but I don't think we can lift that."
*And I don't want to try,* she added to herself.
The machinery in the water didn't look dangerous,
and it was pretty clearly broken,
but it was still a machine,
and machines couldn't be trusted.

"I guess," Gumption said.
"But see that bit?"
He pointed at a rectangle of crystal circuitry bobbing gently up and down,
attached to the rest of the machine by only a few wires.
"I bet we can pry that off."
Without waiting for her to answer he waded back in,
grabbed hold of the circuitry,
and pulled.

The wires that connected it to the rest of the wreckage went taut but didn't come free.
"Mmph! Come *on*!"
Gumption braced one foot against the machinery and heaved.

"Look out!" Maddy exclaimed as the wires suddenly pulled free.
The foot Gumption's weight was on slipped out from under him.
As it slid across the riverbed it knocked a few crucial stones out of the way.
The machinery shifted, trapping his foot.

"Argh! Maddy! Help!"
He windmilled his arms frantically,
trying not to be pushed under the water
as the machine's weight bore down on his leg.

Maddy splashed over and grabbed the shoulder straps of his overalls.
She pulled as hard as she could.
"Harder!" he shouted,
clutching at her shoulder.

She wrapped her arms around his chest and heaved,
but it was no use.
The machinery had driven his foot into the soft bottom of the river.
Everything they were doing was just shifting its weight even more.
If she let go of him to run for help
he wouldn't be able to keep his head above water!

"Help!" she shouted.
"Someone! Help!"

"Responding!" a rasping mechanical voice answered.
"Danger! Extricate! Extricate!"
A battered bot burst out of the trees
and hurtled down the gravel toward them!
