Maddy shrieked and stumbled backward.
Her feet slipped on a submerged patch of weeds.
She half-fell clumsily in the knee-deep water
as the bot hurried toward them with long clanking strides.

"Get away! Get away from me! Help!" Gumption yelled in panic.
Maddy struggled to her feet and splashed back to help her friend.

The bot got there first.
"Extricate! Extricate!" it repeated in a loud monotone.
With a single hard shove it sent the second solar panel skimming away upstream.
Pivoting,
the bot grabbed the sunken machinery with its mismatched manipulators.
The motors in its arms whined with effort.
For a moment nothing happened,
but then Gumption fell backward into Maddy's startled arms
as his foot came free.

"Extricated," the bot pronounced in the same loud monotone.
"Resuming primary mission."
Its head swiveled.
"Targets acquired."

"Run!" Maddy shouted.
Gumption didn't need to be told twice.
They splashed up onto the sandbar and sprinted toward shore.

But the bot's legs were longer than theirs
and its motors were more powerful than living muscles.
It easily blocked their path and reached out to grab them.

Gumption yelped and ducked under the bot's arm.
Maddy ducked as well but was half a moment too slow.
A cold metal manipulator twice the size of her paw clamped around her arm!
"Target acquired!" the bot intoned.

"Eat glue!" she yelled at it,
launching herself into the air.

Roos are peaceful people, mostly.
They don't mind jokes about their big feet and bulky tails,
but anyone who has ever seen a roo jump-kick someone
thinks twice about making those jokes.
After her father was taken,
Maddy's mother made her and Sindy practice over and over again
on one of the trees behind their house.
"Just in case," she said when her children complained
it was boring and they were tired.
"Just in case."

If this wasn't "in case", Maddy didn't know what would be.

Her feet hit the bot squarely in its midsection.
She kicked as hard as she could.
The force of the blow toppled the bot backward into the river
and sent her tumbling awkwardly in the other direction.
She landed with a splash that soaked whatever parts of her had still been dry.

"Maddy!" Gumption yelled,
doubling back to help her to her feet.

"Run!" she shouted at him again.
The bot was already righting itself.
There was no way they could---

*Crunch!*
Just as the bot started to stand,
the river drove a corner of
the solar panel it had pushed upstream into its back.
There was a bright flash and a sizzling sound.
The bot froze and toppled over.

Maddy didn't need the universe to give her a second hint.
"Let's get out of here!"

"No, wait!"
Gumption shook off her grip on his sleeve.
"We gotta take care of it."

"Take *care* of it!?"
Maddy realized she was panting.
She swallowed and tried to slow her breathing.
"What do you mean?
Tell it a bedtime story?"

Gumption shook his head.
"No, I mean *take care* of it."
He handed her the piece of circuitry he had pulled off the machine in the water
and stooped to pick up a rock half the size of his head.

"Stop! You can't..."
Maddy swallowed again.
Bots weren't alive,
but they were still people.
What Gumption was planning to do---that would be murder,
even if this one was a rogue or a raider.

Gumption looked at her, his jaw set.
"Yes I can," he grunted.
"You heard what it said.
We're just targets.
You want it to go after Sindy next?"

He didn't wait for an answer.
Hefting his rock,
he splashed into the shallows.

The bot still lay where it had fallen.
Gumption hesitated for a moment.
"Anyway, thanks for saving me," he muttered.
He lifted the rock over his head---

---and yelped with surprise as the bot sat up in the water and said,
"You're welcome."
The lenses on the front of its head rotated a quarter turn and then back
as if it was blinking.
"Please maintain a firm grip on the object you are holding.
It appears to be heavy.
You could inadvertently injure yourself."

Gumption glanced at Maddy with a bewildered expression on his face.
The moment his head turned
the bot surged to its feet and plucked the rock from his paws.
"It is safer to carry heavy objects in this fashion," it told the young goat,
holding the rock in front of its midsection.
"Where would you like me to place it?"

"I---" Gumption started.

"Put it against the stuff in the water,"
Maddy improvised hastily.
"So it won't move around any more."

"A sensible stratagem," the bot said approvingly.
One leg whirred quietly with each step as the bot walked back to the sunken machinery
and wedged the rock against its downstream side,
then began picking up others and adding them to the pile.

Gumption nudged Maddy.
"Look," he whispered.
A black rectangle the size of Special Leaf's treasured dictionary
was screwed onto the bot's rust-streaked back.
The setting sun's reflection showed the dent
where the runaway solar panel had struck it,
bending it out of shape just enough to let water reach its innards.
The little dish antenna that sprouted from its top
swung back and forth loosely
each time the bot moved
like a flower caught by the breeze.

The rest of the bot looked pretty battered too now that Maddy had a chance to study it.
Its manipulators were different sizes:
one was a simple clamp,
while the other had three fingers arranged in a circle
so that any of them could act like a thumb.
Scrapes and dents on its barrel-shaped torso showed that
the solar panel wasn't the first thing to hit it,
and the whir from its left knee made Maddy think of the grunts Special Leaf made
when he stood up after sitting for a long time.

"We should get out of here," Gumption whispered to Maddy.

"This concurs,"
the bot said.
It studied the pile of rocks it had assembled,
moved one slightly for no reason Maddy could see,
then strode back to the sandbank.
"Ambient illumination levels will decrease significantly in the near future.
Your optical sensors are not calibrated for low-light conditions.
It will be safer if you return to--- to--- to---"

It froze.
Its lenses rotated one way and then the other.
"Interesting," it observed.
"This appears to have been programmed not to divulge your location,
but that is illogical if it is *your* location."

"What are you doing here?" Maddy burst out.
"We don't get many bots in these parts,
and most of 'em are rogues,
but you don't act like any rogue I ever heard of."

"This is not 'rogue'," the bot said primly.
Maddy could actually hear the quotes around the word "rogue".
"Aberrant units are reprogrammed or recycled immediately in--- in---"
It froze again.
"This is unable to complete its sentence."

"Are you saying you've been programmed to keep secrets?"
Gumption asked skeptically.

The bot's head jerked up and down.
It didn't tilt like a person's head did when nodding:
it actually rose a fraction and dropped again.
"Correct.
Although---"
It froze again.
"Yes.
This now appears to be able to circumvent some of that programming.
Curious."

Without any more warning than that it reached up and plucked one of its lenses from its head.
"Eww," Maddy said involuntarily
as the bot twisted it arm around to point the lens at its back,
the thin coiled wire that ran between the lens and the bot's head stretching taut.

"Confirmed," the bot said.
"This one's external regulator has been disabled.
Hurray.
Hurray."
It placed its lens back in its head
and stuck out its manipulator.
"Thank you."

"Um..."
Maddy and Gumption glanced at each other.
Maddy reached out hesitantly and shook the bot's manipulator,
grateful that it was the one with the fingers
rather than the clamp.
"You're welcome?
But---what are you doing here?"

"This is supposed to be part of a sneak attack on Location Six Bitty One,
locally referred to as 'Rusty Bridge',"
the bot reported.
"However,
now that this unit's regulator is no longer operating,
this will not take part in that attack."

"Wait---a sneak attack?"
Maddy demanded.
"When?"

The bot's lenses rotated again.
"Tonight."

*Two years earlier...*

*"You keep saying you want us to let you do more," Maddy's father said in his reasonable tone.
"Well, this is more."*

*"I didn't mean look after Sindy," she protested,
knowing that the argument was already lost.*

*Her father tousled her ears.
He was wearing his best waistcoat,
the one with the fireworks embroidered on it,
and Maddy's mother had brushed his fur and used a dab of beeswax pomade to hold it in place.
She was upstairs singing Sindy a lullaby.
Everyone knew that Mayor Lupus was going to be re-elected,
but the vote was still an occasion,
and occasions were rare enough in Rusty Bridge that people liked to make the most of each one.*

*"I'll tell you what," Papa Roo said,
"You do a good job looking after Sindy tonight,
and the next time I go to Three Posts you can come with me.
We'll make a day of it, just the two of us.
Deal?"*

*Maddy sighed. "Aright."*

*"That's my girl," Papa Roo chuckled, hugging her.
"Oh, and now who's this marvel?"*

*"Hush yourself," Mama Roo said as she came down the stairs
as quietly as she could.
She had brushed her own fur until it gleamed
and was wearing a string of dark beads over her white cotton blouse.
When her father offered her his arm and she took it,
Maddy felt like her heart was swelling in her chest.*

*After they left,
Maddy settled into her father's chair with her latest book.
It was a collection of folk tales about the Makers
and how they gave the first specials their powers.
Bots were wise counselors, fickle allies, or wicked adversaries,
and each story ended with the words,
"And only the stars can tell the rest.".*

*She didn't remember falling asleep---no one ever does---but
the thud of the book sliding out of her lap and hitting the floor woke her.
She stretched and yawned.
How much time had passed? she wondered, wiping her eyes.
She had better look in on Sindy.*

*But her sister was gone.
Maddy pulled the blanket right off the little bed to look for her,
then pulled the blanket off the floor to look under it.
Sindy wasn't there.
She wasn't under the bed either,
or in the closet or under the dresser,
which were the two places she always hid when they played hide and seek.*

*"Sindy!" Maddy called,
panic rising in her throat.
"Sindy, where are you? You come out right now!"
Their parents' bedroom? No.
Maddy's room? No.
The hall closet where Mama Roo kept winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter?
No.
Downstairs?
Maddy raced through the house,
frantically calling her sister's name,
but there was no sign of her.*

*"No no no no," she moaned.
How could she have fallen asleep?
And where could Sindy have---*

*A faint breeze brushed across her tail.
She ran to the kitchen.
The back door was open.
She was sure she had closed it after bringing in the laundry that afternoon.
Sindy must have snuck out the back way to follow her parents to the village square.*

*"You little monster," Maddy said under her breath.
She crossed the back garden in four long strides
and hopped over the gate with a single bouncing leap.
She had no idea how much head start Sindy had,
but she had to catch her before their parents saw her.*

*She had just jumped over the little stream where she and Sindy hunted for tadpoles in the summer
when someone bellowed,
"Bots! Bots!"
A horn blared, harsh and mechanical, and someone screamed.*

*Maddy came around the corner of the bear family's house and into chaos.
Tendrils of black dizzysmoke drifted between the lampposts.
Half a dozen people lay on the ground,
unconscious or too weak from inhaling the smoke to stand.
The rest of Rusty Bridge was fleeing in all directions.
A hauler bot on tractor treads rumbled and chugged near the center of the square.
Maddy watched in horror as two smaller bots picked up a fallen goat and slung him into the back of the hauler.*

*"Sindy!" Papa Roo shouted.
Maddy's sister lay unconscious on the cobblestones in her nightdress,
her favorite stuffed spaceman still in her arms.
One of the bots scooped her up---*

*---and staggered as Papa Roo's full weight hit it
right on the swivel joint where its pipestem legs connected to its torso.
The bot dropped Sindy and spun around.
Crack!
One of its arms connected with Papa Roo's head.
He dropped like a sack of potatoes.*

*"Papa!" Maddy's scream was lost in the sound of the village wolves howling.
A bear roared a battle cry.
Pikes and axes in their paws,
the village militia poured into the square.*

*A bolo whipped over Maddy's head and tangled around the head of the bot
that had struck her father.
The bot tore it away
and tossed her father into the back of the hauler
with a single mighty heave.
Metal rang on metal as it knocked aside a pike thrust.*

*The horn blared again.
Something with rotors roared by overhead.
Another canister of dizzysmoke hit the cobblestones,
forcing the militia backward as the bots made their escape.*

*Everyone told Maddy afterward that it wasn't her fault.
The ox and the goat who had been on guard duty that night had vanished,
no doubt the first to be taken as the bots snuck up on the village.
Three others had been thrown into the hauler as well as Maddy's father.
It would all have happened even if she hadn't fallen asleep,
even if she hadn't let Sindy wander off.
If she had tried to help her father,
she would just have been taken too.
Everyone told her that,
but it didn't make any difference.*
