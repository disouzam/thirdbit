"Wake up. Sindy, wake up!"
Maddy shook her sister gently, then more firmly.

Sindy grunted and snuffled.
"Wha?" she mumbled,
hugging her knees to her chest and shaking her head 'no'.

"Sindy, come on.
We have to get out of here.
We have to warn everyone!"
*Again,*
Maddy added to herself despondently.

Sindy blinked and rubbed her eyes.
"I don' wanna get up."

"You have to,"
Maddy said as gently as she could.
"Look."
She pointed at the screens two meters away.

Whimpering,
Sindy sat up and rubbed her eyes again.
"It's Lasercase and the other bots,"
Maddy explained.
"They're going back to Rusty Bridge."

Sindy stared at the screens for a moment
and began to cry,
quietly and hopelessly.
"It's not fair.
No, don't!"
She pushed away Maddy's hug.
"I'm really hungry and my head hurts and I just want to sleep
and I don't know where we are
and there's nothing we can do
and it's *not fair*."
She buried her face in her hands.

"Well,
you could always try pushing some more buttons,"
Maddy joked lamely.

"Stop it!"
Sindy snapped,
teardrops glistening on her furless cheeks.
"It's not my fault stuff happens sometimes."

"I didn't mean---" Maddy began,
startled,
but her sister wasn't finished.

"I don't know why stuff works for me when it doesn't work for you.
I don't know why, why they took papa an' they didn't take me,
but it isn't my fault!"

Maddy wrapped her arms around her little sister.
"I know, I know, I know," she repeated softly,
rocking Sindy back and forth
just like she had when they were both little
and Sindy woke up with nightmares.
"Nobody thinks it's your fault.
None of this is your fault."

Sindy sniffled,
her face buried in Maddy's shoulder.
"Papa's dead, isn't he?" she said.
"Like those, those people in the other room."

"No. No, he's not. Look."
Maddy took the sketch book from the desk behind her and opened it.
"See?
This was his, remember?
And these drawings---he must have been watching us through those screens.
He made notes, too.
See?
This one's how I figured out how to turn everything on.
Here, budge over."

She sat down beside her sister.
so that they could page through the sketchbook together.
Open-mouthed,
eyes wide,
Sindy ran her finger over one drawing after another.
"Is he still here?" she whispered.

"I don't know."
Maddy shook her head.
"I wish Dockety would wake up.
Or that Special Leaf was here---he could just blast a way out.
Rrrrr..."
She made a rumbling sound in her throat
and shook her paws in the air.

"What was that supposed to be?" Sindy scowled.

Maddy let her paws fall to her sides.
"Special Leaf using his powers."

Sindy rolled her eyes,
then jumped and squeaked as the cleaner bot rolled up to them.
"What's that!?"

"It's aright," Maddy reassured her.
"It just keeps the place tidy.
Oh, but what's *this*?"

The hatch on the cleaner bot's back slid open.
Its spidery arm unfolded and tentatively offered a chain of carefully-cleaned paper clips to Maddy.
"Oh, aren't you a good little bot?" she said,
holding the paper clips up to show Sindy.

The cleaner bot rocked back and forth for a moment
before turning and rolling back to its slot in the wall.
It returned a few moments later to give them a ruler and three pencils.
Maddy's breath caught.
All three were dark green,
with small dents near the end where someone had bitten down on them while thinking.
"Papa's," she told Sindy softly,
running her finger over the tooth marks.

The bot came back again with two carefully-folded sheets of paper.
"Thank you," Sindy said.
"Here, would you like this?"
She slipped her string bracelet off her wrist and held it out.
The bot hesitated,
then plucked it from her fingers and raced back to its nest.

Sindy giggled.
"It's silly."

"Yeah," Maddy said,
taking the papers from Sindy and smoothing them out on the desk.
They were the pages from her father's notebook,
and once she turned them around the right way
they fit together to make a map.
Maddy's heart raced.
The 'X' must be where they were.
And the other 'X' at the end of the dotted line---was that the way out?

A buzz and a click made her turn her head.
Dockety's manipulator twitched.
Its lenses rotated.
The lights inside them slowly brightened.
"Are you awake?" Maddy asked hesitantly,
setting the map aside.

The bot's manipulator clicked a rapid staccato.
"Cognitive... functions... coming... online..." it said slowly,
its voice full of static.
*Click click click.*
"Full self-awareness restored.
Good morning."

Maddy let out her breath in a relieved whoosh.
"Good morning," she replied.
She had been afraid that Dockety would never wake up,
and even more afraid that if it did,
it would speak in Patient's voice.
"Did you---um, sleep? Well?"

"This one does not sleep,"
the bot said,
unplugging itself from the wall
and tucking its charger cable back into its chest.
"But adequate power levels have been restored for us to proceed.
Our next step should be reconnaissance."

"Well, I've been doing a little reconnaissance of my own,"
Maddy said.
"Look."
She held up the pieces of the map.
"I think my father made this.
It must be how we get out.
And we have to go right now."
She pointed at the screens behind her.
"Lasercase and the others are headed for Rusty Bridge again.
We have to warn them."

The bot looked from the map to the screens and back to the map.
"Processing... Yes.
Your map agrees with the base schematic this one downloaded while recharging.
That path does indeed lead to an exit."

"But then what?"
Sindy asked.
"There's no way we can get home in time to warn everyone."

"Incorrect," Dockety said.
"It may be possible."

"How?"
the sisters asked simultaneously.

The bot picked its arm up off the desk and studied it.
"Substantial reconfiguration will be necessary.
We must hurry."

"Wait!"
Maddy bent down and whistled softly.
When nothing happened she whistled again more loudly.

The hatch in the wall slid open.
The little cleaning bot rolled partway out,
then froze at the sight of Dockety and began to withdraw.
"It's aright," Maddy said hastily.
"It won't hurt you."
She smiled at the cleaning bot,
coaxing it all the way out into the room.
"We're leaving now---would you like to come with us?"

The bot rocked back and forth,
then rolled back into its hiding place.
"It cannot leave its duties without appropriate authorization,"
Dockety said.
"There is nothing we can do.
Come---we must hurry."

The door opposite the one they had come through opened onto yet another corridor.
*I'm going to have dreams about this,*
Maddy realized as they hurried through it,
*And they're not going to be happy dreams.*

With Dockety leading the way they passed one door after another.
The bot turned left,
turned right,
and went straight through a four-way junction.
Maddy traced their path as well as she could on her father's map.

Finally they were one heavy dash away from the 'X' on the map.
The door in front of them looked no different from any of the others,
but Dockety clacked its big manipulator a couple of times
as if cracking its knuckles.
"Be prepared," it said quietly.
"We may encounter opposition."

"You mean another fight?" Sindy asked resignedly.

"Possibly.
If that occurs,
depart as rapidly as you are able.
This one will attempt to safeguard your exit."
It reached for the plate in the door.

"Wait."
Maddy put her paw on its arm.
"Thank you.
For everything."

The bot's lenses rotated.
"You are...welcome."

*Click.*
*Whoosh.*
The door slid open.
Cool, damp air rolled over them.
It smelled like mud and rotting plants.
It smelled like outside.

Maddy followed Dockety and Sindy
into a room so vast it could have held the whole of Rusty Bridge.
Lampposts every fifty meters cast cold white light over strange pieces of machinery,
some piled together in jumbles,
others neatly sorted and stacked,
and others still that dwarfed the cargo bot
that had hauled Sindy and the goats away from Rusty Bridge.

There were shelves too,
long rows of shelves that were taller than the mayor's house back home
but still didn't reach even halfway to the arched ceiling
barely visible above them.
Boxes and drums and coils of cable,
arms and legs and wheels and tentacles...

"So many components," Dockety said,
its voice rasping even more than usual.
"So many units that could be repaired.
This is wrong.
This is *hoarding*."
It waved its arm at a nearby shelf.
"This one could be completely refurbished with these parts alone!
Four---five---six more like this one could be constructed!"

"What's this for?"
Sindy asked,
picking up a semi-circle with mechanical fingers hanging from it.

"Put that down,"
Maddy ordered.
"We shouldn't touch anything, aright?"

"Aright," Sindy said.
She dropped the semi-circle back on the floor.
Its edge struck the end of a rod,
flipping the palm-sized spoked wheel on its other end into the air.
The wheel clattered against a sheel of metal,
which slowly tipped forward and crashed to the floor.

"Sindy!"
Maddy scolded.

"I'm sorry!"
she said.

Dockety took a step toward the fallen piece of metal.
"Batteries," it rasped.
There on the shelf behind where the sheet of metal had been
lay a dozen blue glass cylinders,
each one glowing faintly.
"Those are nuclear batteries.
They are---this one has never actually seen one before."

"Is that a good thing?" Maddy asked.

The bot picked one up and turned it over,
its green lasers scanning it carefully.
"Yes," it said, almost reverently.
"This is a very good thing."

And then all the lights went out.
Heavy machinery began to rumble all around them.
"You should not take things that are not yours... yours... yours...,"
Patient's voice crackled from a hundred speakers,
echoing off the distant walls.
"And when you downloaded a map of this facility,
you should have computed that this one would detect your activity
and predict your most likely course of action."

The lights came back on.
Maddy whirled around.
They were surrounded by bots on all sides!

Dockety's head spun from side to side.
"Delay them,"
it ordered.

"How!?" Maddy asked.
At least a dozen bots stood in the circle around them.
Some were bulky haulers like the two from the control room.
Others had once been cranes designed to stack and unstack tall shelves,
or repair bots bristling with tools,
but all were covered in the same mind-bending mixture of scraps and spare parts as Patient.
And none of them looked even a little bit friendly.

Dockety pulled a contraption that looked like a miniature windmill off the nearest shelf.
"This was meant for your kind,
but it can be modified."
Its manipulator clacked as it calculated.
"Alterations require two minutes and thirty-five seconds.
You must delay them."

"But *how*?"
Maddy almost wailed
as one of the bots revved its engine menacingly.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"Be creative.
It is what your kind do best."

Maddy looked around wildly.
She didn't know what the bots were waiting for,
but they probably weren't going to wait for long.
If only her father had left instructions on---

That was it.
"Stop!" she said loudly as the bots began to advance,
holding up her father's sketchbook.
"I found your instructions.
Your protocol,"
she added desperately,
remembering the word that Patient had used.

The bots froze.
A speaker crackled.
"Repeat that," Patient said.

"I found the Makers' protocols,"
Maddy said.
"The ones you *haven't* been following.
They're going to be very disappointed."

Silence,
broken only by the sound of Dockety unscrewing things from the windmill one-handed.
"That is an inaccuracy intended to induce desired behavior!"
Patient said.

Maddy smiles wickedly, her heart pounding.
"You mean a bluff?
Nope.
I'm a roo,
and everyone knows roos never bluff.
Go ahead,"
she went on bravely.
"Look it up in your data thingy."

Static crackled on the speakers.
"There is no record of such an assertion in the database,"
Patient said indignantly.

"Then your database is incomplete,"
Maddy improvised wildly,
looking from bot to bot
the way she had seen Mayor Lupus look from person to person
when speaking to a crowd.
She didn't need Patient to believe---she just needed
enough of the bots around her to.

"You are fabricating!"
For the first time Maddy heard anger in Patient's voice.

"Oh yeah?
Then how come I have *this*?"
She pulled the circuit board she'd taken at the river out of her pocket
and held it up.

*Click.*
A crane bot turned on a spotlight welded to its single long arm
and shone a beam of bright white light on Maddy's upraised paw.
A moment later it rolled back a step in surprise.
The bots around her began to rattle quietly.

"That is not yours,"
Patient said.

"Is too."
Maddy turned slowly so that all the bots around her could see it.

"Look out!"
Sindy shrieked.

Maddy ducked instinctively.
A manipulator on an accordion arm snatched at the circuit board.
She pressed the button on it frantically.
Nothing happened.
"Catch!" she shouted,
tossing it to her sister.

Sindy caught it,
fumbled,
fumbled again,
and pushed her thumb down on the button.
The bots froze.
Their running lights dimmed and went out.
"Rebooting," a mechanical voice said flatly.

"What...?"
Sindy looked around in amazement.
"Did I do that?"

Maddy hugged her.
"You sure did.
Dockety!
We have to get out of here before they wake up!"

"Agreed."
The bot turned to face them.
"This should serve as sufficiently rapid transportation."

Maddy's jaw dropped.
The bot had attached the windmill to its chassis---though
it would be more accurate to say it had attached itself to the windmill.
"What...?"
she said again.

"It is a personal aerial transport device,"
the bot explained.
If it had been a person,
Maddy would have said it sounded just the teensiest bit smug.
"But there is only one harness.
You will have to share."

It only took a moment for the bot to buckle them into
the straps that now hung from its sides.
They were stiff with age and neglect,
but when Maddy tugged on them they felt strong.
*Really strong,* she told herself,
swallowing the lump in her throat.

*Bing! Bing! Bing!*
All around them bots chimed musically.
Their lights came on.
"Aright,"
Maddy said breathlessly.
"Let's go."

The windmill on Dockety's back started to rotate,
faster and faster until it was just a blur.
For one irrational moment Maddy wondered what would happen if she stuck her paw into it,
but then Dockety ran straight at one of the hauler bots.
Step step step *up* onto the bot.
It flung itself into the air and then they were flying.

Almost.
Maddy and Sindy screamed in unison as they dropped for one heart-stopping second
and then roared into the air again.

"Stop!
Your departure is not authorized!
This is not protocol!"
Patient's voice crackled from all around them.
Up and up they went toward the patch of dawn in the ceiling.
With a roar they were through and into the honey-warm light of dawn.
