A short story called "And Should I Fall Behind" that I wrote
after [my brother's death]({{ '/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/' | relative_url }}) three years ago
is featured in [the latest issue of *On Spec* magazine](https://onspecmag.wpcomstaging.com/2021/01/06/issue-115-coming-soon/).
I hope you enjoy it.
