*Dang! Dang! Dang!*
The alarm bell rang cold and clear,
three peals and three again.
"Get those things out of here!"
Mayor Lupus yelled,
waving her zap gun at the smoking canisters.

The ox with the hammer was moving even as she spoke.
With a mighty bellow she swung her hammer.
*Clunk!*
The cylinder rolled across the cobbles,
dizzysmoke still pouring out of one end.
*Clunk!*
She brought her hammer down on the nozzle,
raised it for another blow,
then sat down suddenly.
"I..." she said, puzzled.
Her eyes rolled up and she toppled over.

"Clear the square!
Clear the square!
And you two, get inside!"
The goat twins didn't have to be told twice.
Tossing his crutches aside,
Bravo fled up the stairs and into the mayor's house right behind his twin brother.

"Maddy!"
She whirled around.
It was Gumption!
For a moment she thought he was going to hug her,
but he pulled up short.
His fur was matted with mud
and there was a leaf stuck to his leg
and she didn't care.
She threw her arms around him and hugged him close.

"Um..." he said,
returning the hug awkwardly.

She released him and stepped back,
suddenly embarrassed.
"Sorry.
Come on,
we have to get out of here."

"Wait!"
Gumption pointed at Dockety.
"It's trying to say something!"

Dockety rasped and crackled
Its plating was dented,
and one of its legs was definitely bent.
Maddy and Gumption knelt and helped it sit up.

"Come *on*!"
Maddy repeated urgently.
Another few seconds and the dizzysmoke would reach them.

Dockety pushed them away and limped back to the flying harness
that still lay where they had fallen.
Its joints squealed in protest as it tried to pick it up.

"Leave it!"
Maddy said frantically,
trying to pull the bot away.

Dockety shrugged her off and switched the rotor on.
It flapped and whipped and roared to life.
Bracing itself,
the bot pointed it at the nearest canister
to blow the dizzysmoke away.

"Aright!" Gumption shouted,
then, "Oh no!"
as Dockety's feet slipped on the cobbles.
The flying machine was so powerful that it was pushing him backward.

Maddy and Gumption braced their shoulders against the bot's back
and pushed as hard as they can.
The bot's whole body was vibrating so much
that Maddy expected parts to start falling off,
but it was working---the wind from the rotor was clearing the smoke!

"Here they come!" someone shouted.
With a rumble that made the ground shake,
the big cargo hauler rolled into the square.
The militia yelled and charged.

*BZZZP!*
*BZZZP!*
The mayor fired her zap gun twice, then swore.
"Damn thing's out of charge!
Leaf-you gotta slow 'em down!"

Special Leaf nodded grimly.
He pulled up his sweaters' sleeves,
braced his feet,
and swept his arms in a circle.
The earth split in a ragged arc in front of the cargo hauler
under the sheer force of his concentration.
He swayed and stumbled and went down on one knee, exhausted.
A goat dropped her pike and ran to help him up.

*Clang! Thwack!*
All around the square militia and bots battled each other.
As the last of the dizzysmoke wafted away
Dockety switched off the rotor and dropped it on the cobblestones.
"Bzzt brrzzzt crackle," it said,
pointing at the mayor's house and pushing Maddy toward it.
"Bzzt crackle!"

"No!"
Maddy protested.

Gumption pulled on her arm.
"Come on,
we have to get out of here!"

With an earth-shaking rumble,
Crusher rolled across the ditch that Special Leaf had made.
Dockety turned to face the cargo hauler and stepped in front of it.

The cargo hauler stopped.
"Bzzt crackle," Dockety said.
Its chest light flashed on and off,
*blink blink*, pause, *blink blink*, pause,
like a heartbeat.

The cargo hauler hesitated.
*Blink blink*, pause.
Dockety spread its arms.
Slowly,
Crusher raised its own---

---and froze,
the motors in its shoulders grinding in protest.
Prancing on its crab legs,
Lasercase stepped into view from behind the heavy hauler.
"Denied!" it crowed in a weirdly echoing voice.

Dockety charged at it,
limping on its bent leg.
The crab bot punched a button on the control box it held in its tentacles.
Crusher's arm swung like a bat,
faster than Maddy would have believed it could move.
Metal banged on metal as it knocked Dockety flying across the square.

"No!" Maddy shouted as Lasercase advanced on the fallen bot.
Suddenly she remembered the circuit board still in her pocket.
She pulled it out and pointed it at the crab bot and pressed the button.

"Ha! Ha! Ha!"
the crab bot crowed.
"Priority target revealed!"
It scuttled toward Maddy,
tentacles raised.

"Ooph!"
Gumption tackled her to the ground.
The bot's tentacles whipped over her head.
The circuit board skittered across the cobblestones.

"Got it!"
Gumption grabbed the circuit board,
rolled over,
stood up---

---just in time for a tentacle to club him in the ribs.
"No!" Maddy shouted again
as the young goat landed in a heap beside her.
"Gumption!"

Lasercase snatched up the circuit board.
A bullhorn popped out of a hatch on its back and blared loudly.
The bots immediately began to retreat,
but Maddy barely noticed.
"Gumption! Gumption!"

He twitched and coughed.
"Uhh..." he groaned.

"Don't move," she said.

"Not... much... chance... of... that..."
he gasped.
His eyes closed and he went loose-jointed in her arms.

"Help us! Help us, please, someone!"
Maddy cried,
rocking him back and forth in her arms.

The next thing she knew
Mama Roo was gently loosening her arms and pulling her to her feet.
"Let them help him,"
her mother said as Maddy tried half-heartedly to push her away.
One of the oxen and a young wolf---Wilbur, Maddy though dazedly,
his name was Wilbur,
he was the mayor's grandson---placed Gumption on a stretcher.

"He's going to be all right, isn't he?"
Sindy asked in a very small voice.

Mama Roo squeezed her daughters.
"They'll fix him up," she promised.

Zeke the bear lumbered over,
his ax on his shoulder.
"Wait!"
Maddy her mother away and stepped between the bear and Dockety.
"What are you doing?"

The bear hefted his ax.
"Finishing this one off."

"What? It was *helping* us!
Didn't you see?"
Maddy glanced down at Dockety's motionless form.
A single lonely light blinked on and off in the corner of the screen on its chest.
It looked like it needed a mechanic just as badly as Gumption needed a doctor,
but the nearest bot mech was---Maddy didn't even know.

"Don't listen to her,"
a harsh voice said.
Bluster came down the steps of the mayor's house and pointed at Dockety accusingly.
"I saw it talking to the big one, the one that hauled us away.
We can't trust it!"

"Yeah, and where'd you see that from, 'fraidy toad?"
Maddy snapped.
"Upstairs hidin' when everyone else was down here?"

Bluster's paws bunched into fists.
For a moment Maddy was sure he was going to swing at her,
but instead he pulled the ax out of Zeke's confused grip.
"Only good bot is a scrapped bot.
If you won't fix this, I will."
He raised the ax,
took a step forward,
and yelped as something invisible knocked him off his feet.

"No,"
Special Leaf said coldly.
The old tortoise could barely stand,
but his glare was as bright as Dockety's lasers
and the arm pointed at Bluster was as steady as a mountain.

Bluster scrambled to his feet.
He looked back and forth between the special and the bot,
then spat on the cobblestones and walked away without saying a word.

"Thanks," Maddy said to the old tortoise,
helping him sit down.

Special Leaf nodded.
"What was that thing they took from you?"

Maddy shook her head.
"I don't know.
It rebooted the ones back in the bunker,
but it didn't seem to work on Lasercase."

"They seemed to want it pretty bad,"
the tortoise said.

Something inside Dockety went *ping*.
Its chest screen flashed on and off twice.
Words began to form.

"Are... you... all... right?"
Maddy read aloud one word at a time.
She knelt down beside the crippled bot.
"Yes,"
she said.
"We're all right.
I mean,
mostly,
I guess."
She stopped herself from patting the bot's dented plating.

"Not... its... fault..."
the bot flashed.

This time Maddy did pat it.
"I know it's not your fault.
You never mind Bluster---he's an idiot."

"No,"
the bot flashed.
"Not... Crusher's... fault...
Regulator... made... it... hit... this... one...
Not... its... fault..."
Its screen dimmed,
leaving only the blinking light.

Special Leaf put his arm around Maddy.
"There is nothing we can do.
It needs parts, and..."
The tortoise shrugged helplessly.
"We don't have them."

Maddy stood up,
her jaw set.
"There's always something we can do."

The bot was heavier than it looked.
Eventually they had to tilt the trundle cart
Maddy took from the little alley beside the mayor's house
so that Zeke could roll Dockety onto it.
She gave Special Leaf a hug and set off for home.

Maddy expected her mother to protest,
but all Mama Roo said was,
"There's space on the porch---that'll be out of the rain."
She and Sindy helped Maddy wrestle Dockety's loose-limbed form up the steps.
The three of them sat in silence,
Sindy in her mother's lap and Maddy leaning against her shoulder
as they waited for the kettle to whistle.

*Phweee...*
Mama Roo slid out from under her younger daughter,
who grumbled sleepily and curled up into a ball.
"I'll make tea," Mama Roo said.

Maddy nodded,
staring at the sketchbook in her lap without really seeing it.
Tea sounded wonderful.
It also sounded like a lot of work.
Her stomach kept rumbling,
but all she wanted to do was curl up like her sister and sleep and sleep and sleep.

She closed her eyes.
*Just for a moment,* she told herself.
She hoped Gumption was all right.
And Dockety.
Her breathing slowed.

The sketchbook slid from her hands and hit the porch with a soft thud.
She blinked and reached for it,
frowning.
The thump had knocked a folded piece of paper loose
from its hiding place inside the back cover.
She gentled tugged it free and unfolded it.

A chill ran up her spine.
She stared at the page,
then tucked it back into the sketchbook,
stood up,
and set it gently on the swing seat.
"Look after mama,"
she said softly,
bending over to kiss her sleeping sister on her smooth, furless cheek.

Mama Roo came out a few minutes later,
two cups of tea in her hands,
and frowned.
"Maddy?
Where are you?"

Maddy was panting by the time she got back to the square.
"Wait!" she gasped,
pulling up short in front of Zeke and panting for breath.
"I'm---I'm---"
She pointed at the flying machine the bear had just dumped in a wheelbarrow
and shook her head vigorously.
"I'm supposed to take that."

The bear frowned and scratched his muzzle.
"Nobody told me nothin'."

"Go ask the mayor if you want,"
Maddy bluffed,
gesturing vaguely at something behind the big bear.

Zeke shrugged.
"Makes no nevermind to me.
But you bring the wheelbarrow back as soon as you're done, you hear?
We got a long day in front of us."

Maddy nodded,
grabbed the wheelbarrow's handles,
and rolled it down a side street where no one could see her.
It took her a moment to figure out how to pick up the flying machine---it was
lighter than she expected,
but the big rotor turned so easily in her hands that she couldn't get a decent grip.

Finally she managed to prop it up on top of a rain barrel.
She tightened the straps as far as they would go
and slid her arms through them,
then snapped the belt shut around her waist.
Taking a tentative step,
she hefted its weight on her shoulders.
It was looser than she would have liked,
but to be honest,
she didn't like *any* of this.

"Autopilot," she said out loud.
Nothing happened.
"Autopilot," she repeated more loudly.
"Autopilot!"

"Hey, what are you doing?"
It was Bluster and Bravo,
the latter carrying his crutches over his shoulder.

Maddy began pressing the buttons on the control panel.
"Autopilot! Autopilot!"
Just as Bluster said, "Hey!" again and started toward her,
a mechanical voice said,
"Autopilot engaged."
The rotor began to spin,
and she shot into the air.
