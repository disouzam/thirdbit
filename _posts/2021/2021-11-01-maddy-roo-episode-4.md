*Clunk! Clunk! Clunk!*
"Bother," the old tortoise said mildly,
reaching into the bell and pulling a sock off the clapper.
"I know it can be loud when the wind blows,
but I keep telling the mayor she really shouldn't do that."

*Dong! Dong! Dong!*
This time the bell rang true,
its peals echoing off the walls of the buildings around the square.
*Dong! Dong! Dong!*
Three and a pause to signal an attack.
Three and a pause to bring Maddy's memories of the worst night of her life rushing back.

Windows opened.
Heads poked out.
"What's happening? What's going on?"

"Bots!"
the goat yelled through cupped paws.
"Raiders!
Whole lot of 'em comin' up along the main road!"

Mama Roo grabbed Maddy's arm.
"You and Sindy get back to the house *now*," she ordered.

"I'm not leaving you!" Maddy protested.

"You'll do as I say, young lady!"
Fear made her mother's voice stern.
"Sindy, you go with your sister.
You gotta run, both of you, fast as you can."

"I'm not going 'less you are!" Sindy said stubbornly.
She was crying,
Maddy realized,
only then realizing that there were tears on her own cheeks as well.

"Go with them,"
Special Leaf urged Mama Roo.
"Keep them safe."

"Aren't you comin' with us?" Sindy asked the old tortoise plaintively.

Special Leaf smiled a wrinkly smile.
"No.
I am tortoise,
and tortoises don't run from fights."
He winked.
"Mostly because we can't."

But suddenly it was too late to run.
A tricycle bot roared into the square,
waving its twig-thin arms to keep its balance
as one back wheel came up in the air.

"Get outta here, you!" shouted the goat who had sounded the alarm.
Shirt tails flapping,
he waved his arms at the bot as if trying to scare a goose back to its flock.

"Look out!" Maddy yelled
as black dizzysmoke began to spew out of the canister on the tricycle bot's back.

The goat didn't hear,
or was too angry or too frightened to pay attention.
He grabbed a rake that someone had left propped against a wall
and charged at the bot.

The bot reversed,
tires squealing on the cobblestones.
A belch of greasy black smoke rolled over the goat.
He stumbled, spun around, and fell to the ground.

"Go!" Special Leaf ordered,
squaring his shoulders.
Something popped as he rolled his head from side to side to loosen his neck.
Between one instant and the next
all the warmth and good humor drained away from his face.
The expression that replaced them sent a chill up Maddy's spine.
For all his love of books and tea,
Special Leaf was a tortoise,
and tortoises were cold-blooded creatures.

Maddy grabbed Sindy,
spun around,
and shrieked as the biggest bot she had ever seen rumbled into the square,
completely blocking the street.
It was practically a slab of metal,
with blocky legs as wide as the double doors of the mayor's house
and arms like tree trunks.
Each leg ended in a pair of tractor treads,
and as it rolled forward
she saw that it was dragging a cage cart behind it.

"Oh no," she moaned.
That cart could only mean one thing.
The bots weren't here for salvage.
They were here to take people,
just like they had taken her father!

"Not today, clunker," Special Leaf said.
He planted his feet firmly on the cobblestones
and swept his arms in a broad circle.

The earth groaned and split under the sheer force of his concentration.
A crack a meter wide opened right in front of the huge bot.
"Ha!" Special Leaf crowed
as one of the bot's treads fell into the fissure.

*Crash!*
The bot fell to one enormous knee.
Its motors roared as it braced a hand on the cobbles
and heaved itself back upright.

Special Leaf raised his arms over his head
and brought them down and around in a great clap
right in front of where his belly button would have been
if he'd had one.
A square of cobbles punched upward in response,
knocking the huge bot off balance once again.

"Get 'im, Special, get 'im!" Gumption shouted.
The young goat grabbed a loose cobblestone off the ground
and threw it at the huge bot
as it staggered and tried to regain its balance.

"Get the other one!
Get the smoker!"
Maddy yelled.
She grabbed a cobblestone of her own and threw it at the tricycle bot
that was still spinning in circles and spewing smoke.

Her stone fell well short.
"I got it!"
Gumption picked up two more cobblestones
and charged at the smaller bot.
One! He missed.
Two! The second stone clanked off its casing.

"Uh oh."
As Maddy and Gumption straightened up with more stones in their paws,
half a dozen more bots charged into the square.

Special Leaf used a word Maddy was sure she wasn't supposed to know
and *pushed* with his mind.
The smallest of the new arrivals flew backward through the air
and hit the front of a building with a crash.
Something with long legs and a small body sprawled full length.

The old tortoise punched the air, one two three.
Cobblestones flung themselves at the raiders,
leaving divots in the ground for them to trip over.
A bot that looked like a trash can with arms and a single wheel
bounced over one hole and veered around another
only to be caught in a sudden rut.
"Nurp ner," it buzzed loudly as its wheel snapped off.
Its body rolled to a halt.
To Maddy's horror,
it righted itself and walked on its hands back to the trench
to pull out the wheel and snap it back in place.

"Go! Run!" Special Leaf gasped.
"I can't keep this up much longer!"

"We're not leaving you!" Maddy cried,
but her mother was pulling her,
saying, "Come on! Come on!"
as the huge hauler bot batted away a clump of flying earth and rumbled forward once again.

"Arrooo! Arrooo!"
Wolf howls sent shivers up Maddie's fur.
In mismatched helmets and salvaged armor,
the village militia charged around the corner and hit the bots from behind.
Some had weighted axes meant for hacking.
Others had long pikes with bent metal hooks on the end
to tangle in bots' limbs and gears.

"Take 'em in pairs!" Mayor Lupus shouted,
raising her precious zap gun to her shoulder and sighting along it.
*BZZZP!*
Purple-blue lightning arced across the square
and hit the trash can bot that had just finished putting its wheel back in place.
It glowed and sparked like a firefly caught in a lantern and fell over,
its mechanical arms twitching.

"Woo hoo!" Gumption shouted,
punching the air with his fist
as Mama Roo tried to drag him away.
"You show 'em, mayor!"
But even as he said it
the other bots flung canisters of dizzysmoke at the villagers.
One hit an ox square in the chest,
knocking him off his feet.
Dark smoke spewed into the air.

Suddenly Sindy screamed.
Maddy whirled around.
Two bots had circled around the village and come in behind them
to block their escape!
"Get away!" the younger roo shrieked as the lead bot tried to grab her.

"Duck!" Mayor Lupus shouted.
*BZZZP!*
A bolt of electricity from her zap gun hit one of the bots.
As it sparked and shuddered,
the second bot wrapped a mechanical tentacle around its midriff.
The purple glow raced up the tentacle and into the second bot.
The second bot's four eyes glowed for an instant,
and then the bot that had been zapped was moving again.

But so was Maddy.
She jumped and kicked with all her might.
The lead bot staggered back.

The second bot knocked it aside and skittered forward on crab-like legs.
A tentacle lashed out, catching Maddy across her thighs.
A jolt ran through her body.
For a moment her mouth tasted like tin foil
and everything had a halo swimming around it.

"Maddy!"
Gumption caught her as she toppled over.

"Mama!"
Sindy cried.
A second tentacle struck Mama Roo in the ribs,
and then the bot had the youngest roo.

*Clank!*
Something hard and heavy hit the tentacled bot in the back.
*Clank! Clank! Clank!*
It buzzed its rage as a hailstorm of stones sailed out of the darkness behind it,
each one finding its mark.
As the bot spun around to face its new attacker,
Maddy saw that it too had a black box fastened to its back.

Stones clattered against the crab bot,
some of them big enough to make dents.
"Withdraw! Ouch! Withdraw! Ouch!"
Its amplified command made Maddy's head ring.
Holding Sindy's limp body with a pair of tentacles,
it scuttled across the square to the huge cargo bot.
Two limp goats lay on the floor of the cage.
The crab bot tossed Sindy in on top of them and slammed the cage door closed.

*BZZZP!*
The blast from the zap gun hit the crab bot in the torso.
It spun around and aimed its tentacles at the militia.
*BZZZP!*
*BZZZP!*
Two bursts of purple electricity shot out of them and struck the militia.
They toppled over.

The big bot rumbled away into the darkness
towing its cart and its three prisoners,
leaving chaos in the village square behind it.
Half of the militia lay on the ground,
dazed by dizzysmoke or shocked by the crab bot's final blast.
Special Leaf was still gesturing feebly,
but was too exhausted to make the stones obey him.
Scattered plates of armor and parts of broken mechanical limbs
proved that the bots had paid a heavy price for their victory,
but as Mama Roo wrapped Gumption and Maddy in a hug
all Maddy could think was that her little sister was gone,
gone just like her father.
