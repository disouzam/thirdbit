"Thank you for saving us,"
Maddy said to Dockety belatedly once the boat was finally out of sight.
"They would have had us for sure."

"Theze onez were *click*,"
the bot replied sadly.
"Thiz one regretz ending them."

"You did the right thing,"
Sindy ventured.
"They were being bad."

"They did not have a choize.
Botz do not have choizez when regulatorz are put on them.
Bots are not bad.
*Regulatorz* are bad."
Its heavy claw clicked a rapid angry staccato.

The river gurgled quietly beside them as they stood for a moment without speaking.
Moonlight gleamed through a break in the clouds.
"More botz will come," Dockety finally said.
"We should not be here when they do."
Something scraped and creaked as it took a step.

"Wait---you're hurt!"
Maddy exclaimed
as the moonlight fell on a dent in the bot's side.
It had hit the sawbot so hard that one of its torso plates had bent inward,
leaving a small gap like a wound.

"Thiz one cannot feel hurt.
But it doez buzz a little,"
the bot admitted.

"Wait!"
Sindy searched the ground.
"Just wait!" she repeated impatiently as Maddy opened her mouth.
"There!"
She scooped a piece of metal off the ground and held it out to Dockety.
"Will this help?"

The bot took it from her.
Its lasers flashed green as it scanned the curved place.
"It zhould be zuffizient," it acknowledged.
With no more ceremony than that it unscrewed the bent plate,
tossed it aside,
and fastened the salvaged piece of metal in their place.

*Eww*, Maddy thought,
slightly queasy at the sight of the impromptu surgery,
but Dockety's lenses rotated.
"That is better," it pronounced,
its voice back to normal.

Maddy nudged her sister with her shoulder.
"Good on you."

Even as she spoke something hooted in the distance.
"How are we going to get *home*, Maddy?"
her sister asked in a frightened little voice.

"I don't know,"
Maddy confessed helplessly.

The hoot came again.
Another answered it.
"There are worse things here than Lasercase and its crew,"
Dockety said darkly.
"We must go."

They set off again,
west toward their distant home.
Dockety took the lead,
scanning the ground with its lasers
and occasionally waving them around bubbling sinkholes
or gloopy bits of especially swampy ground.
Maddy brought up the rear
so that she could be sure Sindy didn't fall behind.
She tried humming a tune for a while,
the way their mother did when they all went for a walk,
but it just made the bent trees around them seem more ominous.

*Sploosh.*
Maddy whirled around.
"What was that?" she whispered loudly.

"Processing."
Dockety's lenses rotated.
"Unknown,
but judging from the volume---"

*Sploosh.*
"Judging from the volume,
and the fact that the frogs have all stopped burping,
it is probably both large and dangerous.
We should adjust course."

They picked their way hurriedly toward higher ground.
It brought them closer to the highway,
but Maddy decided wearily that she was less afraid of Lasercase and the other bots
than she was of something that could survive in the polluted river.

"I'm hungry," Sindy complained.

Well, I'm---"
Maddy stopped herself.
There was no point snapping at her little sister.
"I'm hungry too," she continued gently,
putting her arm around Sindy's shoulders and giving her a squeeze.
"And scared.
I bet Mama's scared too.
Oops!
Sorry!"

Dockety had stopped so abruptly that Maddie walked right into it.
Two green laser beams skittered across the ground for a second.
"There is a path here," it said.
"Processing.
Curious---it is not in the database."

"Does it go up to the highway?" Maddy asked.

"Negative."
Dockety pointed.
"It goes there."

For a moment Maddy couldn't see what the bot was pointing at.
Then she realized that the mound in front of them was too regular to be natural.
The spring floods had washed away enough dirt to reveal part of a concrete bunker.
Most of it was still covered in mud and stunted grasses,
but one entire side now lay revealed by the moonlight.

She swallowed,
her fatigue and hunger momentarily forgotten.
There was a door in the bunker's side,
as thick as her fingers could spread wide,
and it was open.

Sindy took Maddy's paw.
"It looks scary,"
she whispered.

Maddy nodded.
She was about to say they would go around
when she heard another *sploosh* in the river below.
"Do you think it's safe?" she asked Dockety.

The bot's lenses rotated.
"Unlikely.
Very little is safe in this region.
But its absence from this one's database is unusual."

Maddy took a deep breath and let it out.
"Well,
if you don't know about it
then maybe your friends don't either.
Come on."

She started down the path.
Sindy pulled her back.
"Maddy!
It's *scary*.
It looks like it has spiders."

She put her arm around her little sister's shoulders.
"We have to rest somewhere,"
she said into the warm patch of fur on top of Sindy's head.
"And if there are spiders,
Dockety can squish them for us.
All right?"

The bunker didn't look any less scary as they got closer to it.
In fact,
by the time they reached the door
Maddy was wondering about spiders as well.
Would hiding in a patch of trees really be that---

*Sploosh.*
"Right," she muttered.
She was about to slip through the door when Dockety put a manipulator on her arm.

"This one will go first," it said.
Reaching up to its chest,
it slid a small panel to one side to reveal a circle of glass.
Dockety tapped it with a metal finger.
The circle brightened,
dimmed,
and brightened once again
to cast a comforting white light on the ground in front of them.

The door was open just enough for the bot to scrape through.
Maddy and Sindy waited outside,
hearts pounding,
until Dockety said,
"It appears unoccupied."
Maddy shooed her sister through and then followed.

They found themselves in an empty room.
The walls and roof were bare concrete blocks,
and the floor was blanketed with dried mud and blown leaves.
Dockety turned to shine its flashlight on a rust-streaked sign
fastened opposite the door that read,
"Emergency Defenses Control Station".
A broken screen stood on a pedestal beneath it.
Next to the sign and the screen was another door,
this one closed tight,
and a pair of rusty levers.

"See?" Maddy said much more bravely than she felt.
"No spiders."
Sindy nodded but didn't reply.

The older roo picked a spot where the leaves seemed driest
and sat down gingerly.
"We have to sleep for a while,"
she told the bot
as Sindy stretched out beside her and put her head in Maddy's lap.
"Can you wake us when the sun comes up and we'll get moving again?"

"Confirmed.
This one will reduce operational status as well."
The bot's flashlight started to dim.

"Wait---can you..."
Maddy asked.

"Of course."
The light steadied,
not as bright as before but still comforting.
Maddy closed her eyes and was instantly as lost to the world
as her gently snoring sister.

She woke a few moments or an hour later.
Her head felt like it was stuffed with dirty laundry,
and her tongue tasted like something from the river had crawled into it
and made a nest.
She rubbed her eyes.
What had woken her?

As if in answer,
something rustled outside the door.
She held her breath,
hoping it was just the wind or a stray frog,
but the sound came again.

Moving slowly,
she picked a pebble out of the muddy floor beside her
and tossed it at Dockety.
*Clink.*
"Hey," she whispered urgently.
"Are you awake?"

The bot's flashlight brightened slightly.
Its green lasers flashed on and swept across the room.
"Returning to normal operating status,"
it said.

"Ssh! Quiet! Something's out there!"
Maddy put a paw over Sindy's mouth as her sister stirred.
"Listen!"

Nothing... nothing...
*Rustle.*
A long mechanical tentacle slid through the door like a snake,
bits of slimy river weed still clinging to it in places.

"Mmph?"
Sindy struggled in Maddy's lap.

"Ssh ssh ssh," Maddy breathed in her sister's ear.
"Quiet. Be quiet. And don't... move..."

The tentacle curled to the left,
sweeping through the leaves toward the wall.
Dockety waited until it almost touched him,
then stepped over it.

The tentacle began curling the other way.
As Dockety stepped over it again,
Maddy got to her feet as quietly as she could
and pulled Sindy up beside her.
Before Maddy could stop her,
Sindy grabbed hold of one of the levers sticking out of the wall to steady herself.

The lever dropped with a loud *clack*.
Maddy had only a heartbeat to duck and pull Sindy down with her
as the tentacle lifted off the ground and struck the wall.
*Smack!*
The tentacle whipped back and slapped the wall again.

On the wall opposite the door they'd come through,
the second door began to grind open.
"Go!" Maddy ordered Sindy.

"But---"

"Go!"
She pushed her sister forward.
She had no idea what lay deeper in the bunker,
but it couldn't be worse than this.

"But I *can't*!" Sindy wailed.
"It's not open enough!"
She grabbed the edge of the door and pulled as hard as she could.
It scraped open another few millimeters before wedging in the muck below them.

"Help her!" Maddy shouted at Dockety.
Without waiting to see what the bot did
she grabbed a pawful of mud and threw it at the tentacle.
"Hah! Whoa!"
She ducked and rolled under it,
rolling again as it slapped the ground.

Dockety took hold of the inner door with its claw manipulator,
placed one metal foot on the wall,
and pulled.
Its motors whined.
The door scraped open another few millimeters.

"Keep going!"
Maddy threw dry leaves at the tentacle
and jumped as it swept across the floor again.

*Scrape.*
"It's open!" Sindy shouted.
She squeezed through.

*Scrape.*
Dockety gave one last pull.
"Make haste," it said.

Maddy didn't need any more encouragement than that.
She sprinted five steps across the room
as the bot followed her sister into whatever lay behind the door.
Just as she reached it,
something cold and mechanical grabbed hold of her ankle.
