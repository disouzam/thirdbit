"Surrender!" the service bots boomed in unison,
their mechanical voices making keyboards and coffee cups rattle.
They rolled forward side by side---

---only to jam against each other in the doorway.
"Withdraw!"
They rolled back,
paused,
and rolled forward again,
crashing into the door exactly as they had before.

"You gotta be kidding me,"
Maddy muttered.
She looked around wildly.
The door they had come through was closed.
*All* the doors were closed---there was no way out!

"Quick!"
she shouted to Sindy.
"Push a button!"

"What?"

"Which button?" her sister wailed.

"Any button!"
Maddy frantically began slapping her paws on keyboards
and pushing buttons and twisting dials.
A heartbeat later her sister joined in.

"Desist!"
Patient crackled imperiously.
"Your activity is not protocol!
Desist!"

"Desist this!"
Maddy yelled,
yanking a keyboard off the desk and flinging it at their captor.
The keyboard clattered harmlessly fell to the floor.

Beside her,
Dockety picked up a keyboard and studied it for half a second.
"Angular momentum often stabilizies objects in flight,"
it observed,
then spun the keyboard through the air.
*Crack!*
It struck Patient on the side of its head.
*Crack!*
*Crack!*
Two more keyboards shot across the room.

"Apprehend! Apprehend!"
Patient ordered the bulky service bots as it retreated,
waving its mismatched arms to protect itself.

One of the service bots hesitated just long enough
to let the other charge through the door.
For a moment Maddy was sure they would be caught,
but the bot halted a few meters away.
A hatch opened in its side.
A small broom telescoped out of its side
and began sweeping up the scattered pieces of the broken keyboard.

"Incorrect!"
Patient crackled.
Backing up to one of the consoles,
it began typing commands.

The service bot froze mid-sweep.
Its broom retracted into its side.
*It's using the console to control them!*
Maddy realized.

She grabbed another keyboard and flung it at the console,
but missed.
Another keyboard, another throw---it arced through the air end over end,
bounced off Patient's outstretched third arm with a *clank!*,
and landed on the console.
Behind them,
the door they had come through began to open.

"Come on!"
Maddy yelled,
grabbing Sindy and pushing her toward the door.
Her sister didn't need the encouragement.
She raced across the room,
knocking a chair out of the way in her haste.

But where was Dockety?
Maddy glanced over her shoulder.
Her blood went cold.
The other service bot had caught hold of Dockety's arm.
Slowly but surely it was forcing Dockety down onto the floor.

Maddy didn't even think.
She leaped onto the nearest desk with a single bound.
One-two-three she went from desk to desk.
Sindy shouted her name
but she didn't have time to hear it
because she had to jump one more time and *kick!*

It felt like kicking a wall,
but the service bot rolled back a step.
With a *snap!*
Dockety's arm pulled right off its body.
"Go!" Maddy yelled,
ducking as the service bot tried clumsily to grab her.
She snatched Dockety's arm off the floor and bounded toward the door.

"Incorrect!"
Patient crackled angrily behind them as they escaped.
"Incorrect!
All units must---"

The door closed on Patient's words,
leaving them back in the corridor
with only the failing light from Dockety's chest to guide them.

The light dimmed and dimmed again
until it was no brighter than a glimmer of moonlight on a quiet pond.
Maddy grabbed Sindy's arm.
"Stop,"
she panted.
"The hole, remember?"
She felt rather than saw her sister nod.

"Why's your light going out?"
Sindy asked the bot plaintively.

"This one did not have an opportunity to recharge,"
Dockety replied.
"Power must be conserved.
Will scans suffice?"
Its green lasers swept a pair of sharp parallel lines across the floor.

Maddy sagged.
She was so tired...
"We can't see that way,"
she said wearily.
"You'll just have to tell us if there's anything..."
*Anything we could fall into,* she finished in her head.
*Anything that might try to grab us.
Anything we haven't run into or I haven't thought of
that might eat us or lock us in a room.*

She shivered,
then straightened up.
"Come on,"
she said to Sindy as gently as she could.
"Put your paw on the wall and steer with that.
It'll be like a game."

"Pretty stupid game,"
Sindy muttered.

Just as Maddy reached for the wall,
the light in the ceiling flickered and came on.
She whirled around,
expecting to see the two armored service bots,
but the hallway was as empty behind them as it was in front.
*Maybe it's some kind of automatic thing,*
she told herself,
not believing it for a moment.
"Let's go," she whispered loudly.

A speaker crackled.
"Where? Where will you go?"
Patient asked.
"Back to the surface?
The external security system is still active,
and quite upset.
Or perhaps you would like to continue exploring?"
It made a horrible grating *snrk snrk* sound.

That was as much as Maddy could take.
There---set into the wall.
That looked like a speaker,
and even if it wasn't...
She stepped over to it and swung Dockety's arm as hard as she could.
It didn't even scratch the paint.

"Just... shut... up!" she grunted,
hitting the speaker again and again with the bot's torn-off arm.

"Please don't do that," Patient and Dockety said in unison.

Maddy froze.
"What?"

Dockety buzzed.
"This one did not say anything."

"Yes you did,"
Sindy said accusingly.
"You said the same thing *it* said."

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"This one has no recollection of that.
We should proceed while there is light."

Maddy nodded, suddenly ashamed of her outburst.
"Do you want your arm back?"
she mumbled,
holding it out.

They retraced their steps back along the corridor,
Maddy and Sindy side by side and Dockety three steps behind them,
carrying its detached arm like a folded-up umbrella.
Lights came on in front of them and went dark behind them,
just as they had before,
but in the background
Maddy could hear Patient humming a crackly little song to itself.

"Oh, please, shut up," she said under her breath.

"What's the matter? Don't you like music?"
Patient and Dockety asked in unison.

Maddy pulled up short and put out a paw to stop the bot.
"You did it again.
You said the same thing it did."

"This one did not---"
Dockety froze.
Its lenses rotated rapidly.
"Correction.
The base's systems are attempting to subvert this one's motivational integrity."
Its manipulator clacked.
"Without power reserves,
this one will not be able to resist indefinitely.
You should deactivate me and proceed alone."

"What? No!"
Maddy slapped its metal plates angrily.
"There's no way we'll get out of here without you.
And anyway,
we're not just going to leave you behind."
She slapped its plates again.

A hundred tired steps later they reached the hole:
six floor blocks wide and six long,
with one row of blocks clinging to the wall for them to walk on.
"Can you jump it again?"
Maddy asked Dockety.

"Negative," the bot said,
its voice buzzing more than before.
"This one's reserves are almost completely depleted,
and must be devoted to resisting integrity attacks."
Its lenses rotated,
more slowly than they had before.
"This one regrets that it will not see its friend Crusher again."

That earned it another smack on its torso from Maddy.
"Don't say that.
We're all going to get out of here."

"That's what *they* said."
Two voices,
one Dockety's and one crackling through the nearest speaker.
Maddy shivered,
thinking about the skeletons in the lab behind them.

The bot's lenses rotated slowly.
"This one is sorry.
It cannot maintain integrity much longer."

Sindy kicked a loose piece of stone.
"It's not fair," she whimpered.

"Wait," Maddy said.
She picked up another piece of stone and tossed it into the hole.
*Tock... tock...*
She looked at Sindy and then at Dockety.
"Did you hear that?
It's not all that deep.
We could climb down."

"Inadvisable,"
Dockety said.
"We do not know what is down there."

"Well we know for sure there's nothing up ahead.
We barely got away from that tentacle the first time,
and even if that stupid thing behind us doesn't take over your brain,
you're going to run out of power before we get there."
She kicked another chip of stone into the hole
and listened to it hit the floor.
"I wish I'd remembered to bring a rope."

Dockety held up its torn-off arm.
"This one can lower you."

Maddy nodded.
What choice did they have?
"Aright."

A few moments later the bot lay on the concrete floor,
one arm held in the other.
Maddy hugged her sister.
"I'll be right back," she promised.

"But what if you can't climb back up?"
Sindy whispered tearfully.
"What if he leaves you down there?
What if he goes all the way bad?"

"This is an it, thank you,"
Dockety said at normal volume.
"And this will overload its own circuits
before it allows itself to be controlled again."

Maddy gave Sindy one last hug.
"Love you," she whispered,
just as their mother did every night.
She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and sat down carefully on the floor,
her legs dangling into the hole.
Taking a deep breath,
she twisted around onto her stomach,
grabbed hold of Dockety's arm with both paws,
and slid down it into the unknown.
