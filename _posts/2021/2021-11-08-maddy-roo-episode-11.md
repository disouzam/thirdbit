Maddy had never seen the ocean, but she had read about it in Special Leaf's books.
She knew that it was as deep as the highest mountains were high,
and that its bottom was darker than an overcast moonless night.
Strange creatures lives there:
fish whose mouths were half the size of their bodies,
wriggling things like glowing ribbons
and bots that looked like lobsters on stilts,
all of them patiently waiting to consume whatever came to them from above.

As she slid down Dockety's arm,
she wished her imagination would shut up for once.

Her foot slid past the manipulator at the end of the arm.
She gulped.
She could probably still climb back up,
but if she went any further...

"Aright?"
Sindy asked.
Maddy was only a meter below her sister,
but it felt as great as the distance between them and home.

"Yeah," Maddy lied.
She swallowed shakily.
"Here goes nothing."
She slid down further until her paws were on Dockety's wrist
and stretched her leg.
Was that the floor she could feel with her toe?
She stretched even more.
Maybe?

She let go of the arm,
and then let out her breath as her feet landed on a floor
that felt so wonderfully solid she could have hugged it.
"It's aright!" she called up.

Sindy slithered down next.
Maddy caught hold of her sister's ankles
as she frantically swung her legs.
"Don't---I'm---just---whoops!"
Sindy fell into her arms,
nearly knocking her over,
then slithered out of Maddy's hug.

"It's colder down here,"
Sindy shivered,
then squeaked as a red emergency light came on in the ceiling above them.

"Yeah."
Maddy cleared her throat.
"That was really brave of you."

Sindy shrugged.
"Nah," she said, pleased.
"I figured if you could do it..."
The sisters grinned at each other,
the strangeness around them forgotten for just one moment.

Then it was Dockety's turn.
Maddy caught his detached arm
and watched as he lowered himself as far as he could with the other
and then extended his wheel.
"You still have about a meter to---never mind,"
she said as Dockety dropped and bounced on his wheel.

"Ouch,"
he said in a toneless voice.

"Did that hurt?" Sindy asked anxiously.

"This one does not feel pain."
Dockety paused.
"But this would not actively pursue a repeat,"
it admitted.

Maddy handed Dockety back its arm.
The bot took it before turning its head
to study the square red emergency light in the ceiling.
"The interference has stopped," it announced.
"The miscreant is no longer attempting to subvert this one's systems."

"Well that's good news."
Maddy patted the bot's plating awkwardly.
"Come on, let's see if we can find you somewhere to recharge."

The lower corridor was as empty as the one above had been.
The red lights didn't come on automatically:
by trial and error they found they only lit up when Sindy said something.
"Because you're so squeaky,"
Maddy joked,
brushing away her sister's half-hearted punch.

Maddy kept waiting for Patient's crackling voice to taunt them from a speaker,
but it never came.

A double hundred steps later they came to a door.
"Armory Number Four," Maddy read aloud,
tracing the faded words with her finger.
She glanced at Dockety,
who had been moving slower and slower.
"Maybe we can find you a new arm here," she said,
trying to make it a joke.

The bot didn't reply.
Maddy and Sindy exchanged worried looks,
and then the younger sister
pressed her hand against a square plate in the the door.
*Click.*
The door slid to the side.

White lights in the ceiling,
proper big beautiful white lights
that revealed a room filled with rows of metal shelves
higher than Maddy was tall.
Most of the shelves were empty,
but one entire side of the room still held
canisters with three-armed caution labels stenciled on their sides.

"There's another door,"
Sindy said,
pointing to a corner.
It too opened when she pressed the square plate
where a handle would normally have been.
Another corridor,
another set of red emergency lights,
more tired footsteps...
"How are you doing?"
Maddy asked Dockety.

The bot took a moment to answer,
and when it did,
its voice was slower and raspier than before.
"Power reserves at two percent."
Maddy didn't know what "percent" was,
but "two" didn't sound like very many.

Another door---this level seemed to be made of them.
*Click.*
More white light that made her squint after the dim red in the corridor.
It was a control room like the one where they had met Patient.
*How many of these are there?* she wondered.

Dockety pushed past her.
Four clumsy steps took it to a section of the wall
with a dozen square black receptacles.
It opened a panel in its torso with its remaining arm,
pulled out a cable,
and plugged itself in.

"Is it working?" Maddy asked.

Silence.
"No."
There was no emotion in the bot's voice.
"Power reserves now at one percent.
Entering emergency maintenance mode.
Goodbye."

"Wait!"
Sindy hurried over to a console like the one that Patience had used
and began pressing one button after another.

"Stop! Sindy, don't!"
Maddy reached for her.
"What if you turn something on?"

"What if I *don't*?"
Sindy shot back.
*Click click click,*
and then there was a deep hum so low that they felt it more than they heard.
The lights above them flickered and steadied.

"Power on," Dockety said.
"Recharging."
Its head swivelled.
"Thank you.
This one will recharge faster if it shuts down its other functions.
Full operation will resume... shortly..."
The lights behind its lenses dimmed.

"Dockety?" Sindy asked hesitantly.

"Ssh," Maddy whispered.
"It's sleeping."
*I hope,* she added in her head.
"Come on,
let's see what we can find."

It only took them a few minutes to discover that the answer was "not much".
Desks bigger than their beds,
chairs that definitely hadn't been made for people with tails,
flat screens coated in a fine layer of gritty dust,
panels full of buttons that Maddy told Sindy she wasn't allowed to press---nothing
they could eat,
and nothing that told them how to get home.

"Lie down and take a nap,"
Maddy told her sister the third time Sindy yawned.
"We can't do anything 'til Dockety wakes up."

Sindy nodded,
climbed onto a desk,
stretched out,
and was snoring softly in seconds.
When Maddy patted her shoulder softly,
she rolled onto her side and pulled her legs up to her chest,
just as she did in bed in the morning when she didn't want to get up.
"I'll get you home,"
Maddy said quietly.
"I promise."

*Click.*
She whirled around at the sound.
A hatch like a mail slot opened at floor level in the wall
just a meter away from where Dockety stood.
A flat little bot rolled out.
Square and gray,
it made a whirring sound as it began to move back and forth across the floor
as it began to clean the room.

The bot rolled under a desk.
A moment later the desk rose a few centimeters into the air
and the whirring resumed.
The desk settled back onto the floor and the next one rose.
*How many times had it done this?*
Maddy wondered.
How many years had it spent cleaning a room that no one used?

A third desk rose.
Maddy crouched down to see how the bot was lifting them.

*Thud.*
The desk came back down suddenly.
The bot rolled back like a startled rabbit.
"Whoa whoa whoa," she said coaxingly.
"It's aright.
You don't have to be afraid."

The bot didn't move.
Maddy smiled.
Could it even see her?
"We're lost," she said.
"I don't suppose you know the way out?"

The bot spun in a circle and rolled away.
When Maddy didn't follow it rolled back and spun in another circle.
"Aright," she said,
straightening up.
"I'll come look."

The bot led her to a desk that had even more screens on it than the others.
A panel slid aside in its top.
A delicate arm unfolded and reached for a drawer.
A mechanical finger as delicate as a dandelion stem
punched a code into the keypad on the front of the drawer.
*Click.*
The bot pulled the drawer open,
then folded up its arm and spun in a circle.

Maddy looked inside.
Her breath caught.
"What...?"
She lifted out a sketchbook bound in dark green canvas and brushed it off.
"How...?"

She opened the sketchbook with trembling paws,
already knowing what she would see.
Deft lines and cross-hatching,
all in pencil,
all done by a sure and loving paw.
There was her mother's face, smiling.
There was Sindy holding a ball.
And there was *her*,
frowning slightly in concentration as she read a book that the artist hadn't finished drawing.
It was her father's,
the one he always carried in a pocket in his overalls in case inspiration struck.

She flipped through it.
Two pages had been torn out.
After that all the drawings were floor plans and bots,
crowded around with notes in his tiny, precise lettering.
He had been here,
and judging from his notes
he had been trying to find a way to escape.

The last few pages were empty.
She held the book up and shook it,
hoping that maybe he had written a note or *something*,
but nothing fell out.
She closed the book and pressed it to her chest.
The skeletons in the upper control room...
No.
She shook her head.
No,
that *couldn't* have happened to him.

She opened the book again.
One of the last pages had the word "Surveillance" written at the top and underlined.
Beneath it was a drawing of the control panel she was standing in front of.
Arrows labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" pointed at buttons that had been colored in.
She took a deep breath and looked down at the little cleaning bot.
"May I?" she asked.

The little bot rolled back and forth.
"Aright."
She pressed the first button,
the second,
the third,
the fourth.

*Click.*
*Click.*
*Click.*
The screens in front of her came to life.
An empty stretch of highway...
A forest clearing that somehow looked familiar...
Something too dark to make out...
And the old village square,
the one with the Makers' black glass pillar in it.
As she watched open-mouthed the scenes shifted slightly,
left to right,
right to left.
The forest was where they had caught up with Dockety.
There must be cameras inside the pillars---which meant
that the bots could have been watching them since, since forever!

"Oh," she said without realizing it
as her mother and Mayor Lupus stepped into one of the scenes.
They were in the square, arguing.
The button that had brought that screen to life was blinking.
She pressed it.

"We have to go get them!" her mother's voice said.

"They were taken by bots, Ibby."
Mayor Lupus was sympathetic but firm.

"But they escaped!" her mother protested.

"Into the Mire,"
the mayor said gently.
"With bots chasing them.
They could be anywhere by now.
And it's the Mire,
Ibby.
You know the stories."

"I will go."
The hidden camera scanned left to reveal Special Leaf
and a handful of the village militia.
Bluster and Bravo were there too, she saw.
They had made it home.

"I will go look for them,"
the old tortoise repeated.

"You won't come back,"
Bluster said warningly.
"There were bots all over the place,
dozens of them.
There's no way they could have escaped."

"You *liar*," Maddy said unbelievingly.

Motion in another screen caught her eye.
She glanced at it and froze.
A dozen bots rolled past the camera on the highway.
She recognized some of them:
the one that looked like a trash can,
the one with too many legs,
and Lasercase---it was the raiding party that had attacked Rusty Bridge.

As the camera panned to follow them she saw
the half-sunken metal sphere she and Dockety had passed.
They were heading back to the village,
she realized.
The bots were about to attack Rusty Bridge again!
