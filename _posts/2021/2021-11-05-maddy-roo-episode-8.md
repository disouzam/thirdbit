Maddy screamed.
She tried to pull her leg free,
bu the tentacle's grip was iron-strong.
"Help! Help!"
She flung pawfuls of dirt and dead leaves at the tentacle
as it dragged her across the floor.

Dockety scraped through the door behind her
and flung itself at the tentacle.
"Release! Release!" it rasped,
grabbing the loop around Maddy's leg
and straining to pull it off her.

Maddy kicked again and again but couldn't get her ankle free.
"Release! Imperative! Release!"
Dockety hit the tentacle with its heavy manipulator
and grabbed it again,
but the swamp slime was too slick to get a solid grip.

"Maddy!"
Sindy squeezed back into the room through the rear door and ran to her sister.
With her hands under Maddy's armpits
she pulled until her feet slipped out from under her.
"Get off her!" she shrieked at the tentacle.

Suddenly Maddy had an idea.
She jackknifed and fumbled with her bootlace,
cursing herself for having tied it so well.
The braided string was clagged with mud
and so damp that it might as well have been dipped in glue.
"Come on come on come on," she muttered frantically.
There!
Her fingers finally found purchase.
She pulled one end loose and hastily undid the rest of the knot.

"Pull!" she yelled at Dockety.
As the bot hauled back on the tentacle,
Maddy braced the heel of her other boot against it
and yanked her trapped foot free.
She was out!

As she scrambled to her feet
the tentacle realized its prey had somehow escaped.
It threw the boot across the room and lashed out,
trying to find her again.

*Clunk!*
The boot hit the second lever on the wall next to the inner door.
"Grab it!" Maddy told Sindy.
"No, not the boot!
The lever!
Pull the other lever"
She didn't know what would happen,
but it couldn't be worse than---

Sindy pulled down hard on the second lever.
Rumbling and grinding,
the outer door began to close.

The tentacle lashed out one last time
before slithering back so that it wouldn't be cut in half.
"Go!" Maddy ordered Sindy.
With Dockety right behind them,
they squeezed through the inner door.

They found themselves on a small platform at the top of
a flight of broad concrete stairs.
Even with Dockety's chest light at its brightest,
they couldn't see how far the steps went.
"Did you go down?" Maddy asked her sister in a hushed voice.

Sindy shook her head.
"We were waiting for you."
Without warning she flung her arms around Maddy and hugged her hard.
"I was *scared*."

Maddy hugged her back.
"I was scared too."
She sniffled.
"But remember what Mama always says.
If you can't give up, you have to keep going.
Come on."

Squelching her foot back into her boot,
she took her sister's paw,
and was only mildly surprised when Dockety took her other paw
with its smaller manipulator.
Side by side,
they descended into the unknown.

Maddy counted steps under her breath as she went.
Ten, twenty, thirty---wait.
"Why are they so clean?" she whispered to Dockety.
There were no dry leaves,
no cobwebs,
not even dust under her finger when she ran it over the wall.

"Unknown,"
the bot replied.
"This one has analyzed the gap in its database.
It is clearly deliberate.
Something erased the existence of this facility.
That is unlikely to be good news,"
it added bleakly.

Forty steps, fifty...
"Maybe you just can't find it because we knocked that thing off you,"
Maddy suggested to fill the silence.

"Negative.
The regulator was an involuntary alteration."
Its chest light brightened angrily for a moment.
"Lasercase attaches them to whatever bots it can catch,
then uses them to catch more bots."

"And people,"
Maddy added bitterly.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"Correct.
But this one does not know why it collects people.
It does not keep them."

Maddy glanced at the bot.
"Then where do they go?"

"Unknown."
The bot buzzed for a moment.
"This one does not know if it ever knew.
It spoke about it sometimes with---"

Dockety froze mid-step,
making Maddy and Sindy stumble.
"What's wrong?"

The bot buzzed again.
"This one *remembers*.
This one remembers speaking with---with Crusher.
The modified GX-470 cargo hauler's name is Crusher."

"Um... good?"
Maddy ventured.

"Very good,"
Dockety said.
"This one does not know why,
but those memories create strong positive feedback."

"Strong positive---you mean they feel good?
So he's a friend?"

Dockety hesitated.
"This one...thinks so?"
It swiveled its head to look at Maddy.
"But Crusher is an 'it', please, as is this one."

"I'm *hungry*,"
Sindy interrupted before Maddy could think of a suitable reply.

"I know,"
the older roo said,
squeezing her sister's hand.
"If I had any cookies, I'd let you have them all."

Sindy sniffled.
"You could keep one."

Maddy kissed the top of her sister's head.
"Thanks."

"This one also needs to recharge,"
Dockety buzzed.
"Will you be able to navigate with reduced illumination?"
Its light dimmed until it was no brighter than a birthday candle.

Maddy gulped.
"Sure," she said as bravely as she could.

Sixty, seventy...
The steps brought them to a corridor
made of the same featureless gray concrete as the stairs.
Square glass panels sat in the ceiling every dozen steps,
the light they must once have cast long since dimmed.
There were no doors,
no side passages,
no turnings or signs or anything else
that might give a hint what the complex was for or who had built it.

Maddy counted off fifty steps,
then another fifty.
"I don't suppose any more of your memories have come back?"
she asked Dockety to fill the silence.

"Negative."
Its head swiveled to look at her.
"But---"

"Look out!" Maddy exclaimed a heartbeat too late.
The hole in the floor had been just another shadow
until they were right at its edge.
Maddy jerked to a stop,
but Dockety took one extra step.

She grabbed its arm and pulled as hard as she could.
The bot was heavy---much heavier than a person would be.
Its motors whined as it teetered on the edge of the hole,
fighting for balance.

*Crack!*
The floor tile under the bot's foot snapped in half.
Dockety half-fell into the hole.
Its torso hit the floor with a *clunk!*
For one terrifying moment Maddy was sure it was going to fall all the way in,
but somehow the bot got a grip on the concrete.

Sindy stumbled backward to get out of the way.
Her paw hit a patch of wall directly beneath one of the darkened lighting panels.
Something *clicked*.
Above their heads and all along the corridor,
the lights flickered and came to life.

Maddy helped Dockety scrape its way out of the hole.
The bot got back to its feet.
Its lenses rotated rapidly.
"Thank you," it said.

"Sure,"
Maddy panted.
She looked up at the lights and then at her sister.
"That's the second time you've done that."

"I didn't mean to,"
Sindy said defensively.

"No, no, it's aright."
Maddy got to her feet and gave her sister a hug.
"It's aright,"
she repeated.
"You keep doing it."

And that was when a crackly voice said through speakers,
"Well, since you're here,
you might as well come and say hello."
