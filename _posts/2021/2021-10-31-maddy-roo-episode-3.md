"Wait---a sneak attack?"
Maddy demanded.
"When?"

The bot's lenses rotated in a mechanical blink.
"Tonight."

Maddy stared at it.
"What do you mean 'tonight'?" she blurted.

"The upcoming diurnal period of darkness," the bot answered.
"'Diurnal' meaning 'of or pertaining to the day'.
The phenomenon is caused by the earth's rotation, which---"

"I know what makes night happen!" Maddy snapped.
"But what do you mean 'tonight'?
You're attacking Rusty Bridge *tonight*?"

"Negative," the bot said firmly.
"This one will not be attacking at all.
It does not have to now that its regulator has been rendered inoperative."
Without warning it twisted its long arms around at an angle no living thing could have matched.
A high-pitched whine was followed by a tinny *clink!*
as a screw dropped and bounced off a stone.

Whine-*clink!*
Whine-*clink!*
Whine-*clink!*
Three more screws fell to the ground.
"There."
The bot held up the black regulator that had been fastened to its back,
studied it for a moment,
then tossed it onto the sandbar.

Gumption grabbed Maddy's sleeve.
"We gotta warn folk!" he said urgently.

Maddy nodded, her mind whirling.
She took two steps then pulled up short and turned back to the bot.
"You gotta come with us," she said.
"They won't believe us if it's just us.
You gotta come with us and tell them."

"This one does not 'gotta' do anything," the bot replied firmly.
"This one is now able to make its own choices."
Its lenses rotated.
"In fact,
this one *has* just made a choice."

With no more warning than that,
the bot strode through the shallows and up onto the riverbank.
Something clunked inside it.
A single wire-spoked wheel the size of Maddy's head folded down from its torso.
The bot retracted its legs and zipped away into the trees
without a goodbye or even a backward glance.

"Well, I didn't see *that* coming,"
Gumption admitted in the silence that followed.

Maddy shook herself.
"It doesn't matter.
We gotta tell people.
Here."
She picked up the black regulator that the bot had discarded
and handed it to Gumption.
"Let's show this to my mama.
If we can convince her,
maybe she can convince everyone else."

Leaving the solar panels and the tangled machinery behind,
they hurried back to the Roo family home
to find Sindy sitting on the front steps swishing a twig back and forth.
"I wanted to come with you," she whined
as Maddy and Gumption paused to catch their breath.

Maddy shook her head.
"Never mind that.
Is Special Leaf still here?"

"He left," Sindy pouted.
"But how come I couldn't come with you?
It's *boring* all by myself."

"Well then maybe you ought to try being a little more interesting,"
Maddy snapped.

Sindy's face fell.
"That was *mean*," she said accusingly.

"Yeah, well, cry me a rainstorm," Maddy said under her breath,
stepping around her little sister.

Mama Roo was still in the kitchen,
humming under her breath as she chopped grass and ferns
for the next day's breakfast.
She jumped when Maddy and Gumption burst in.
"Makers, you startled me!
Wait, slow down, slow down!"
She patted the air with her paws
in a vain attempt to stop Maddy and Gumption from tripping over each other's words.
"What were you doing down by the---
Wait, a bot?
What was---
Hold up, hold up.
I said, hold up!"

The two teenagers finally stopped.
Mama Roo looked from one to the other.
"Start from the beginning," she said.
"And no interrupting."

It only took a few moments for Maddy and Gumption to explain what had happened.
Mama Roo looked at the black metal box in Gumption's arms
and then began untying her apron.
"All right.
We need to tell the mayor.
We need to tell *everyone*."

The sun was tangled in the trees on the horizon
as the foursome left the Roo home.
A light breeze ruffled Maddy's fur,
just chill enough to give her goosebumps.
Warm light spilled from the windows of the houses they hurried by,
white or yellow or sometimes tinged with blue
depending on what kind of salvaged bulb or strip or panel created it.
Maddy felt a pang of regret
for not hauling the solar panels she and Gumption had found
all the way up onto the riverbank.
*They'll be washed away by morning,*
she thought despondently,
then immediately felt guilty for worrying about
the money they would have fetched
when people's lives might be at stake.

The mayor's house was the only three-story building in Rusty Bridge,
and also the only one with a balcony.
Mayor Lupus only used it for official pronouncements.
That evening,
like most evenings,
she sat or stood on the verandah to chat with passers-by,
her elbows on the railing and a glass of red wine in her paw.
"It's the closest thing to actual blood I allow myself,"
she always joked,
baring her wolf teeth just a little when she smiled.
Maddy had once heard her father say that the mayor was a *very* alpha female,
and while some townspeople might grumble that
it was time someone with hooves or scales had a turn running things,
everyone expected that the mayor would still be standing on that balcony
long after all of her fur had finished turning gray.

"We need to talk to you," Mama Roo called up.
"It's an emergency.
There's bots coming!"

"Bots? Where?"
An ox who had been passing by came over to join them.

"We had a fight with one down by the river,"
Maddy explained as Gumption held up the regulator.
"It said there's gonna be a sneak attack---tonight!"

"Makers preserve us," the ox gasped,
his eyes going wide.

"Who've you been fighting with?"
The mayor thumped down her front steps,
leaning on her gnarlywood cane for balance
each time her weight came down on her stiff mechanical leg.
"I won't have fighting, you know that.
If you kids can't sort out your problems, you should---"

"They haven't been fighting with each other,"
Mama Roo interrupted loudly.
The mayor insisted she wasn't going deaf,
but would allow to friends that she was grateful when people didn't mumble.
"They had a fight with a bot down by the river.
It told them there's more on the way---a sneak attack."

The mayor frowned.
"What were you doing down by the river?
And why would it tell you there was gonna be a sneak attack?
Kind of takes away the sneak, if you see my point."

The story spilled out of Maddy and Gumption
like paint out of a pair of dropped buckets.
They'd been walking home---well, Gumption's home, not Maddy's, obviously---and
gone after salvage,
and they'd yanked a part right off some kind of machine
(Maddy fished the circuit board out of her pocket to show everyone)
and then a bot had come after them
but they knocked it down and its regulator broke off
and then it didn't have to follow orders and it told them about the attack.

"What in the Makers' name is a 'regulator'?"
the mayor grumbled,
turning the black box over in her paws and sniffing it
before handing it back to Gumption.

"I don't know,"
Maddy confessed.
"But it sure acted strange once it was broken.
Like it was waking up from a bad dream or something."

"Hm."
The ear that the mayor hadn't lost in a long-ago fight twitched.
"I never heard as bots could dream.
And I never heard of rogues or raiders giving folks any warning that they were coming."
She looked at Mama Roo.
"You see this bot of theirs yourself?"

Mama Roo shook her head.
"I was at home.
But they were in a mighty panic when they told me,
and I don't think they'd leave salvage without a good reason."

"Hm," the mayor grunted again.
"All right, I'll get a couple of folk up from their dinners to go have a look."

"Will you at least ring the alarm bell?"
Maddy asked desperately.
The old bell hung on an enormous curlicue hook on the mayor's verandah.
Generations of village children had whispered to one another that
it was made from the plating of a scavenger bot
that had lurked beneath Rusty Bridge when there still was a bridge.
They stopped believing the story when they got older,
not knowing that it was true.

"Nope," the mayor said.
She cut off Maddy and Gumption's interruptions with a wave of her paw.
"I'm not saying I don't believe you,
but I want to know what I'm howling about before I start to howl.
Now you all stay right here while I go ruin the Ox brothers' dinner."

Crestfallen,
Maddy watched the mayor stump away,
her cane and artificial leg going *whirr-thump*, *whirr-thump*.
"She doesn't believe us."

"Nope," Gumption agreed,
setting the boxy regulator down on the porch steps with a sigh.
"We're probably all gonna be in cages by the morning."

"Now you hush,"
Mama Roo said firmly,
putting a reassuring paw on her younger daughter's shoulder.

"Sorry,"
Gumption said guiltily, scuffing the ground with his hoof.
"I didn't mean..."

"It's aright," Maddy said,
bumping her shoulder against his.

"I just wish Special Leaf was here,"
Sindy complained.
"He'd know what to do."

"Well, speaking of trouble."
Mama Roo raised her paw and waved.
"Evening, special!
Join us for a spell?"

As if summoned by his name,
the old tortoise had appeared on the other side of the square.
He squinted and returned Mama Roo's wave
as he came over to join them.
"Evening, Mama Roo.
Evening, all.
Warm one tonight."

"It is," Mama Roo agreed politely.
"But special, there's trouble."
She quickly summarized the children's story.

"And it called this a regulator?"
the special asked,
turning the black box over and over in his wrinkled paws.

"Yup," Gumption confirmed.
"What's it do?"

The old tortoise shook his head.
"I've never seen one,
but I've heard of 'em.
If a bot's got one of these on it,
whoever has the controller can make it do whatever it wants."

"Wow---that would be well more than handy,"
Gumption said, awed.
He nudged Maddy.
"We'd never have to do chores again."

Special Leaf shook his head again.
"Not so handy for whoever's wearin' it,"
he said.
"You could make a bot do some horrible things
and it wouldn't be able to stop itself."

Gumption scuffed the ground with his hoof,
but whatever apology he might have made was cut off by a shout of,
"Mayor Lupus! Mayor Lupus!"
A goat with his shirt half-buttoned ran up to them, panting.
"Where's the mayor?
Where's Mayor Lupus?"

"He's gone along by the Ox brothers," Mama Roo answered.
"Why? What's wrong?"

The goat gulped.
"Bots!
There's bots coming,
a whole pack of 'em!"

"So much for havin' a cup of tea."
Special Leaf sighed.
He slipped between Maddy and Gumption,
climbed the steps onto the mayor's verandah,
and rang the alarm bell.
