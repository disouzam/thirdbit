As [I announced a few days ago]({{'/2021/09/07/managing-research-software-projects/' | relative_url}}),
I am running an online workshop on "Managing Research Software Projects" on September 29-30
to raise money for [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/).
Tickets are available [on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/managing-research-software-projects-tickets-169833409299)
and the curriculum and schedule are taking shape:
I'd be very grateful for feedback on what's missing
and what you think doesn't need to be covered.

We may also delve into a few bonus topics:

- Making research software robust enough to be run by anyone, anywhere.
- Building good working relationships between academia and industry.
- Making work more findable.
- The basics of personal digital safety (because having a higher profile may attract the wrong kind of attention).
- What to do if you've been fired.
- How to wrap up and move on when the time comes.
