A young man descends into the tombs beneath the city to slay a monster,
a woman plots to steal her niece's youth,
a ghost explains how he earned his name,
and a magician wonders why she can't get an old nursery rhyme out of her head.
With spies, swordplay, betrayal, forbidden love, and a philosophically inclined pair of boots,
*Beneath Coriandel* will appeal to anyone who enjoyed *The Curse of Chalion*,
*The Lies of Locke Lamora*,
or *The Innkeeper's Song*.
