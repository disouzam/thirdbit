<p>Patrick Mackenzie (whom I've never met) gave <a href="http://akshat.posterous.com/patio11-says-hello-ladies">a good lightning talk</a> at the Business of Software that sums up a lot of what we <em>haven't</em> done for Software Carpentry. Any reworking of the material really (really) has to be built around what you (the researchers) need, rather than what we (the programmers) know.</p>
