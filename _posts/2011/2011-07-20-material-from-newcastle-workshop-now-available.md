<p>Back in June, we <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2011/06/programming-for-scientists-at-newcastle-university-june-20-2011.html">mentioned</a> a workshop on computing skills at the University of Newcastle. It reportedly went very well, and <a href="http://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/sciprog/resources.php">presentations</a> and other materials are now available. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.ceg.ncl.ac.uk/contact/pgprofile.aspx?code=515">Elizabeth Petrie</a>, the other organizers, and the presenters.</p>
