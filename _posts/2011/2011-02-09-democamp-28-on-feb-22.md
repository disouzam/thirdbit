<strong>Demos</strong>

We are looking for amazing entrepreneurs, startups and demos. DemoCamp is an awesome platform for reaching the local audience.

We're also looking for up to 5 startups or entrepreneurs to demo a new technology. Selected presenters get 5 minutes to show us the best of their application and then ask the audience for feedback, coaching, and insight from a highly connected cynical crowd. We try to get a group of highly connected and apparently highly cynical entrepreneurs, developers, designers, marketers, investors and others in a room to watch entrepreneurs in a safe environment.
