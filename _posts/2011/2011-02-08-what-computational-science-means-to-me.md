title: What Computational Science Means to Me
---
<p>My latest attempt to define what "computational thinking" actually means is now on the web in draft form–comments would be very welcome. In brief, the eight principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's all just data.</li>
<li>Data doesn't mean anything on its own–it has to be interpreted.</li>
<li>Programming is about creating and composing abstractions.</li>
<li>Models are for computers, and views are for people.</li>
<li>Paranoia makes us productive.</li>
<li>Better algorithms always trump better hardware.</li>
<li>Automation is the key to acceleration.</li>
<li>The tool shapes the hand.</li>
</ul>
