title: What To Demand
---
<p>Peter Norvig (formerly of NASA, now at Google) recently gave a talk titled "<a href="http://www.msri.org/web/msri/online-videos/-/video/showVideo/4197">What to Demand From a Scientific Computing Language</a>".  It's a good talk (and not just because he explains why he's a fan of Python).  I was a bit disappointed, though, by this list:</p>
<p><img src="{{'/files/2011/03/norvig-list.png' | relative_url}}" /></p>
<p>Shouldn't there be a version control system on this list?  And some sort of provenance tool?  OK, that's a trick question: there aren't any provenance tools in widespread use, but what about testing tools?  There are lots of those, and there's even a name ("xUnit") for the whole JUnit-style family of tools across different languages.  Saying "these aren't really core to scientific computing" is sort of like saying "disinfection isn't really core to surgery".</p>
