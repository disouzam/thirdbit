<p>I'm fond of the Software Carpentry logo, but the blue-to-white color fade is difficult to print on coffee mugs, and impossible to embroider on shirts.  Thanks to the talented <a href="http://veronicawong.com/">Veronica Wong</a>, we have a new one:</p>
<p><img alt="Software Carpentry logo" src="{{'/files/2011/06/halfsize.png' | relative_url}}" class="centered"></p>
<p>We'll be converting things over piece by piece as we rebuild the website over the summer.</p>
