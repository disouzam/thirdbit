<p>WebFWD recently <a href="http://blog.webfwd.org/post/13973466029/code-doesnt-build-software-people-build-software">posted</a> a video presentation by UC Berkeley's Prof. <a href="http://facultybio.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty-list/bahrami-homa">Homa Bahrami</a> and her student Claire Rudolph, who studied how Mozilla builds software.  It's full of useful insights about how a distributed mix of volunteers and paid professionals builds world-class software without drowning in information, and is a great example of research in progress.  We'd welcome pointers to more presentations of this kind.</p>
