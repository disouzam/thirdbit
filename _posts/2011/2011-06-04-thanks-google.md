We are very pleased to announce that the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/">Open Source Programs Office at Google</a> has agreed to provide support so that <a href="http://www.arbrown.ca/">Amy Brown</a> can continue to work part-time on <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a> while we put Volume 2 together. Thanks, Google&mdash;we appreciate your help a lot.
