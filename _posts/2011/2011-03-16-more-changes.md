It's trivial by comparison, but since money hasn't materialized for another year of full-time work on Software Carpentry, I'm now looking for a job.  My CV is up to date, and my interview shoes are polished, so if you know of anything meaningful and interesting in downtown Toronto, please give me a shout.
