It's trivial <a href="/blog/archives/4165.html">by comparison</a>, but since money hasn't materialized for another year of full-time work on <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>, I'm now looking for a job.  <a href="/blog/cv">My CV</a> is up to date, and my interview shoes are polished, so if you know of anything meaningful and interesting in downtown Toronto, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">give me a shout</a>.
