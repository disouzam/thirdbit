Years ago, a musician I knew had a studio near King and Bathurst. He wasn't an early riser, so we made a deal: two or three mornings a week, I went in around 8:00 in the morning and wrote for two or three hours. It had a small desk with a comfortable chair, my old laptop, a kettle, a key for the washroom down the hall, and no Internet connection, so once I was there, all I could do was write (or talk to myself, or stare out the window, but mostly write).

I'd like to find a similar space so that I can start writing again. (I've given up trying to do it at home...) I've got an old computer with no wireless card and a small monitor; all I need is a place to put 'em, and a key for the door so that I can get in between 8:00 and 9:00 two or three mornings a week on my way to work. It needs to be somewhere between Queen &amp; Coxwell in the southeast and Gerrard &amp; Greenwood in the northwest, and I'm happy to help with clean up and maintenance in exchange.  If you can help me out, I'd be grateful for a ping.
