Two weeks ago <a href="http://hotyam.ca/">Hot Yam!</a> (a sustainable food co-op at the University of Toronto) submitted a proposal to the Graduate Student Union to operate a full-time, student-organised cafe and student space in their building.  Today, they heard that it has been accepted&mdash;congratulations! But as Jon Pipitone says in <a href="http://hotyam.ca/post/9088244770/hot-yam-all-the-time">his blog post</a>, it's going to take a lot of work to get off the ground, and they could use your help. You can reach them at <a href="mailto:hottestyam@gmail.com">hottestyam@gmail.com</a>, or come by the GSU (16 Bancroft Avenue) at 6:00 pm on Monday, August 22 for a quick meeting about who, what, when, and how to make the world just a little bit better. Hope to see you there!
