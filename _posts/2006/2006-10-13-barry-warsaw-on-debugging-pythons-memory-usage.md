Barry has been part of the Python development team for yonks; <a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=174099">this article</a> is the first of two (or more) that describe how Python is supposed to manage memory, and how to find out what's actually going on.  Good debugging tips for systems geeks...
