A new version of DrProject went live on Pyre this afternoon.  If nothing serious shows up in the next 24 hours, we'll cut the main installation over.  It's leaner, cleaner, tastes better, and has fewer calories---I'm very excited, and very pleased with how quickly Chris, Jason, Sean, and our ever-helpful team of volunteers have pulled it together.  If the next two weeks go as well as this one has, we'll have a 1.0 release in February, and will open up the repository for general contributions then.
