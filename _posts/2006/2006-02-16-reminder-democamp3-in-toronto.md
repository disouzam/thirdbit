From Joey deVilla, a <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/2/16/1766447.html">reminder about DemoCamp3</a> in Toronto on Monday.  (And from me, fatigue: Air Canada called at quarter after eleven last night to tell me that my flight to St Louis this morning was canceled.  I found space with Delta, but thanks to a few tornadoes, it took them three tries to get me here.  The Software Carpentry workshop is tomorrow --- wish me luck.)
