<a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto7">DemoCamp7</a> was held last night in a pub downtown.  It started late (A/V issues), and while there was a good crowd, I was a little let down by the demos themselves: Cameron Browning's home-made data glove and 3D web site visualizer felt kind of 1990s, and all we got to see of <a href="http://www.paruba.com/">Paruba</a>, <a href="http://www.feelingbullish.com/">FeelingBullish</a>, and <a href="http://www.domainer.com/">Domainer</a>'s page-building tool was the UI, not the technology behind it. Damien Conway's lightning tour of <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/">Perl 6</a> was entertaining, but please, could they do some usability studies before letting people overload the letter 'd' as an operator?
That said, it <em>was</em> a good crowd, and I enjoyed seeing how people were using AJAX, Ruby On Rails, and other shiny new toys. <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto8">DemoCamp8</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto9">DemoCamp9</a> are already filling up; look forward to seeing you all there.
Note: Damien is talking tonight (Wednesday, July 5, 2006) at 6:30 pm in Room 1180 of the Bahen Building at the University of Toronto, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=40+St+George+St,+Toronto,+ON,+Canada&ie=UTF8&ll=43.660172,-79.396799&spn=0.006582,0.021629&om=1">40 St. George St</a>.  Everyone is welcome.
