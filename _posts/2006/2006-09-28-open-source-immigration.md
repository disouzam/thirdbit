This <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2006/09/26/218713/Academics+study+open+source+collaboration+process.htm">Computer Weekly</a> piece pointed me at a project that's studying <a href="http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/hazard/">immigration into open source projects</a>.  Interesting stuff: the curves <em>are</em> similar to the naked eye, so my next two questions would be:
<ol>
  <li>What factors account for the differences between projects?</li>
  <li>What do the curves look like when you divide the population by first language, geographic location, gender, age, etc.?</li>
</ol>
See also Susan Sim's paper on <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ses/papers/ramp.pdf">software immigrants</a>: these concerns aren't traditionally part of software engineering, but I believe they have as much influence on success or failure as technology choices or modeling tools (probably more).
