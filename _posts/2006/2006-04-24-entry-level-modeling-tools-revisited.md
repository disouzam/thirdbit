Regular readers will know that one of my interests is entry-level modeling toolsâ€”i.e., modeling tools that undergraduate students can learn in an hour or two, and that they will believe actually improve their productivity after using on just one assignment.  I've come across two more candidates: Dependency Structure Matrices, as embodied in <a href="http://www.lattix.com/gettingstarted/LDMdemo-03-01.htm">Lattix LDM</a>, and the more traditional odds and ends in Structure101, from <a href="http://headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/demos/">Headway Software</a>.  I'd be interested in opinions, feedback, and what have you from people who've used either.

(And for those of you who once wore a Nevex shirt: gosh, but the matrices in the Lattix tool look familiar, don't they?)
