The <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2">Software Carpentry</a> lecture on <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/binary.html">binary data</a> is now up on the web.  The content of this one has been fairly stable for a while, but that just means that all the bugs will be in the details---comments and corrections are greatly appreciated.
