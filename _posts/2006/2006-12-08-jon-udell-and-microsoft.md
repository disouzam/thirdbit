It's official: Jon Udell (the John McPhee of the Internet) is <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/08.html#a1574">joining Microsoft</a>. Why?  Because, "This isn't your father's—or maybe your older brother's or sister's -- Microsoft. Initiatives like [several he describes] matter, they're solidly in line with my own agenda, they're being pursued in very open ways, and I want to help move them forward."  So, congratulations and best wishes—I look forward to more years of informative, insightful discussion.
