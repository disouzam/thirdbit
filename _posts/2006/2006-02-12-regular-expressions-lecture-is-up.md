The Software Carpentry lecture on <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/re.html">regular expressions</a> is now on the web.  It's a bit of a jump from the previous lecture on <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/design.html">design</a>, but given how shaky the latter was, I needed the cuddly warm blanket of working on something I'm sure I understand.  As always, comments and corrections to me, please.
