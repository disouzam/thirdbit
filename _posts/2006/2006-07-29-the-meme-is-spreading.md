This month's <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/"><em>Seed</em></a> magazine (the first I've ever read, and probably the last as well) has a piece by <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/intersection/">Chris Mooney</a> on how the Bush administration's disdain for science and the "reality-based community" has turned out to be more damaging (for it) than anyone would have expected.  Coincidentally, Joel Spolsky just put this <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/29.html">rant</a> about anti-geek bigotry on his blog.  Coincidence?  Perhapsâ€¦ ;-)
