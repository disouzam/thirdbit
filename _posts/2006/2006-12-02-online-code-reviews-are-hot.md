CSC49X has clearly become a trendsetter: following the lead of our OnLine Marking Tool (<a href="https://www.drproject.org/olm">OLM</a>), Gudio van Rossum at Google has produced an online code review tool called <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html">Mondrian</a>.  Details are still sketchy, though---I wonder if its logo is as good as ours? ;-)
