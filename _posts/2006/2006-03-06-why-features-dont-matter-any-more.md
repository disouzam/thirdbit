<p><a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/v7i07_pfeiffer.html">This article</a>, via <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/3/6/1800118.html">Joey deVilla</a> (again), explains the "new new rules":</p>

<ol>
<li>More features isn't better, it's worse.</li>
<li>You can't make things easier by adding to them.</li>
<li>Confusion is the ultimate deal-breaker.</li>
<li>Style matters.</li>
<li>Only features that provide a good user experience will be used.</li>
<li>Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users.</li>
<li>Unused features are not only useless, they can slow you down and diminish ease of use.</li>
<li>Users do not want to think about technology: what really counts is what it does for them.</li>
<li>Forget about out the killer feature. Welcome to the age of the killer user-experience.</li>
<li>Less is difficult, that's why less is more.</li>
</ol>

<p>They all make sense, but I wonder whether they'll last any longer than the old "new rules"... ;-)</p>
