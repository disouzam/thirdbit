I now have a Windows PC on my desktopâ€”using the Mac laptop as my main computer was making my back and neck ache.  Here's what I've installed so far (in order):
<ul>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Thunderbird</li>
  <li>Microsoft Office</li>
  <li>Cygwin (including Gnu Make and MiKTeX)</li>
  <li>Acrobat (for reading PDFs)</li>
  <li>MWSnap (for screen captures)</li>
  <li>Eclipse (for Java, and as a memory stress tester ;-))</li>
  <li>Wing  (for Python)</li>
  <li>Emacs (I know, I know...)</li>
  <li>A printer drive</li>
  <li>Putty</li>
  <li>SQLite</li>
</ul>
Everything else I need I got by checking out a repository from one of (quick count) four machines:
<ul>
  <li>One set of course notes</li>
  <li>Six CSC49X projects</li>
  <li>Five other projects for the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Computer Science department</a></li>
  <li>The two books I'm working on</li>
  <li>The Software Carpentry notes</li>
  <li>My personal stuff (address list, photos, etc.)</li>
  <li>The web site for third-bit.com</li>
  <li>Some archival stuff that I probably don't need, but like to have just in case</li>
</ul>
Elapsed time: about two hours, during most of which I was reading mail and talking to people.

<em>Later: I have since added:</em>
<ul>
  <li><em>MiKTeX</em></li>
  <li><em>Ghostscript and Ghostview</em></li>
  <li><em>FreeRip</em></li>
  <li><em>PDFCreator
</em></li>
  <li><em>Java 1.5</em></li>
  <li><em><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/myuninst.html">MyUninstall</a></em></li>
  <li><em>Gnumeric (to read old grades files)
</em></li>
</ul>
