The last two lectures in the Software Carpentry course are up:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/dev02.html">Teamware</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/summary.html">Summary</a></li>
</ul>
(where "last" means "last in delivery order", not "last to be revised").  They're both fairly rough right now, so high-level feedback would be more useful than pointers to typos.
