A while back, a few of my 49X students built a tool called <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/2004-fall/psiphon.pdf">Psiphon</a> to measure Internet censorship around the world.  Today, the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060213.NETCOPS13/TPStory/Front">Globe and Mail</a> ran a story on it.  Very cool---<em>very</em> cool.
