Joey de Villa of <a href="http://www.tucows.com">TUCOWS </a>wants to start a <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/5/24/1981807.html">discussion</a> about Toronto's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiative, the aim of which is to move Toronto from the #3 spot in North America (behind Silicon Valley and New York, ahead of Boston) into #2.  Joey feels that plans are currently being shaped primarily by large, slow-moving companies, most of whom only have branch offices in Toronto, rather than by more agile, home-grown outfits.  If you agree—or if you don't—your thoughts would be welcome.
