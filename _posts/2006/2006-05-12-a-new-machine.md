A new machine is always an opportunity to clean house—you simply don't reinstall the things you once thought were worth downloading, and don't copy over the files you no longer need.  So, 56 hours after taking possession, what's on my new laptop?

<strong>Tools</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Apache</li>
  <li>Audacity</li>
  <li>Blitzin (for recreation)</li>
  <li>Cygwin</li>
  <li>Eclipse</li>
  <li>Emacs</li>
  <li>Firefox and Thunderbird</li>
  <li>Gimp</li>
  <li>Gnumeric</li>
  <li>the Google Toolbar (but not Google Desktop—soon)</li>
  <li>MWSnap (for screen captures)</li>
  <li>PDFCreator</li>
  <li>Python (along with PIL, Nose, and a bunch of other libraries)</li>
  <li>WingIDE</li>
  <li>Wink (for making screencasts)</li>
  <li>WinSCP</li>
</ul>
<strong>Projects</strong> (all out of version control repositories)
<ul>
  <li>Beautiful Code (more about this in about three weeks)</li>
  <li>CSC207 and CSC407 (the courses I'm teaching this summer)</li>
  <li>DrProject (which is really close to 1.0, really, I mean it this time)</li>
  <li>our "CS-1 in Python" book</li>
  <li>the third-bit.com web site</li>
  <li>Software Carpentry</li>
  <li>my personal workspace, which has talks, book reviews, and so on</li>
</ul>
I haven't checked out any of the open source projects I'm involved in—there isn't going to be time to work on them this summer.  For much the same reason, this will be the first machine I've owned in six years that has never had Homeworld installed on it... *sigh*
