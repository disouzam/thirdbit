The GTA's Python User Group's next meeting is Tuesday, Sept. 19.  This time around, there'll be a pre-arranged speaker: Aaron Bentley (of Bazaar-NG fame) will be presenting a talk about the Sass web application wiki.

The meeting is at the regular time (6:30pm) on the Third Tuesday of  the Month (September 19th) at our regular location, the inimitable Linux Caffe (a great place to hack), on the corner of Grace and Harbord Streets.
