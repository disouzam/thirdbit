Several 49X alumni and former members of the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a> team have graduated from the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> in the past two weeks --- congratulations to you all.  I'd especially like to congratulate Sean Dawson, who received the Silver Medal from St. Michael's College today --- well done, Sean.
