The <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/debugging.html">debugging lecture</a> is now up for comments and corrections.  It still has the old art work, and the code sample for logging is pending, and it still feels like I'm waving my hands more than in other lectures, so suggestions would be particularly welcome.
