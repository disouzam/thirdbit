It used to be the introductory lecture on testing; now it's more of an introduction to <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/qa.html">quality assurance</a> from a programmer's point of view.  It's changed even more than the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/style.html">style lecture</a>; comments and corrections would be very welcome.  (And yes, I know, the diagrams are missing...)
