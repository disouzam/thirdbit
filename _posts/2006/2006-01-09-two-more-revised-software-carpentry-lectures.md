I have revised the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/shell02.html">second shell lecture</a> and the lecture on <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/version.html">version control</a> for the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc">Software Carpentry</a> course, and added the necessary <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/glossary.html">glossary definitions</a>.  As always, comments are greatly appreciated.
