Last year, <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Dr. Dobb's Journal</a> ran a series of short articles describing some of 2005's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> projects, and we'd like to give this year's participants the same kind of recognition.  Some samples from the last time around are on the new DDJ web site at:
<ul>

</ul>
If you're an SoC mentor or student, please have a look---if you'd like to contribute something similar this year, please write a draft similar in length and format to the examples, and send it with a short bio and photo to the editor, Jon Erickson, at <a href="mailto:jerickson@ddj.com">jerickson@ddj.com</a>.
