Regular readers will know how disappointed I am that <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/184415216">the gender imbalance in open source</a> is even worse than it is in computing as a whole.  I'm therefore very pleased that GNOME has announced a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/">Women's Summer Outreach Program</a>: three women will be given US$3000 to work on two-month projects. As their announcement says:
<blockquote>The recent <a href="http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D16-Gender_Integrated_Report_of_Findings.pdf">FLOSSPOLS report</a> describes many opportunities that women miss out on when getting involved with computing and free software, ranging from being introduced to computers at a later age, being less encouraged to specialise in computing, having few female role models, having less free time to spend programming than men do, and being on the receiving end of sexism when they do try to get involved. We think it's this imbalance that's unfair, and we're trying to help fix it.</blockquote>
Applications close on July 1; please help spread the word.
