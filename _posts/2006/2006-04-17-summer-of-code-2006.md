Yes, it's back: Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> is going to give students grants to work full-time on open source projects this summer.  You can start applying on May 1.  Two U of T students got grants last year; I hope to see at least as many get them this time 'round.
