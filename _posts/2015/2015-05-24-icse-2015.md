<p>
  I have just posted titles and abstracts from
  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/05/icse2015.html">my favorite 24 papers</a>
  from <a href="http://2015.icse-conferences.org/">ICSE 2015</a>
  on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/">Software Carpentry blog</a>.
  As I say there,
  just over half of these papers (13 of 24) had an easily-findable version online.
  I'm not going to do the experiment,
  but I confidently predict that those 13 will be more widely read,
  and more influential,
  than the other 11.
