<p>
  Just a quick update on
  publishing our lessons:
  we prepared the release on schedule,
  uploaded it to Zenodo,
  and then discovered that we couldn't actually specify editors through their web interface,
  only authors,
  even though "editor" is an allowed value in the metadata.
  We also couldn't specify "lesson" as a type:
  our choices were "publication" (which is pretty generic) or "presentation" (which isn't quite right).
  Figshare and COS wouldn't let us do this either,
  but Zenodo is <a href="https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/265">now working on it</a>.
  They hope to release it by the end of June,
  at which point we'll wrap this up.
