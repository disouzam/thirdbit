title: "Keep Me In Your Heart for a While"
---

Shadows are fallin' and I'm runnin' out of breath<br/>
Keep me in your heart for a while<br/>
If I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less<br/>
Keep me in your heart for a while

When you get up in the mornin' and you see that crazy sun<br/>
Keep me in your heart for a while<br/>
There's a train leavin' nightly called "When All is Said and Done"<br/>
Keep me in your heart for a while
