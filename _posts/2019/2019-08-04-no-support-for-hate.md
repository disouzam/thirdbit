Twitter, Cloudflare, Shopify, and Amazon won't care if they lose my business:
I'm just one consumer.
They *will* care if programmers refuse to work with them
because they can't survive without our skilled labor.
So:

> I will not work with,
> or attend events sponsored by,
> any company that has been cited as an inspiration by a mass killer,
> or any company that provides hosting or other services for such companies.
