<p>
  The next couple of days are going to be busy,
  with bootcamps in <a href="http://luispedro.github.io/2014-06-15-khbp/">Amman</a>
  and Toronto,
  and at Duke,
  UC Davis,
  and Claremont Colleges.
  The week after will be just a crowded:
  we'll be at
  the universities of Reading
  and Notre Dame,
  the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society,
  Rockefeller University in New York,
  and an event for women in science and engineering in Philadelphia.
  As always,
  we're grateful to our hosts and instructors
  for making all of this possible.
