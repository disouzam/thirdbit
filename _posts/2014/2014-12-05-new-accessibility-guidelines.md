  Software Carpentry values the participation of every member of the
  scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and
  fulfilling experience.
  Thanks to Pauline Barmby,
  we now have an accessibility checklist
  for instructors and workshop hosts.
  Please have a look
  and send us fixes and suggestions for improvements.
