  A new update of Derek Jones'
  <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/"><em>Empirical Software Engineering Using R</em></a>
  is now available.
  At 283 pages,
  it includes an introduction to statistics,
  an overview of the forces shaping actual software engineering practices,
  lots of practical case studies that students can work through,
  and <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ESEUR-references.html">almost 700 references</a>.
  What's more,
  the <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data">code and data are all on GitHub</a>,
  along with <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-workshop">slides to use in workshops</a>.
  This is a tremendous resource,
  and we hope the community rallies behind it.
