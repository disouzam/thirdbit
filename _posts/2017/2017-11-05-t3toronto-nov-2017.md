We're holding another meetup on Tuesday, Nov 14, 2017
for people interested in teaching tech skills
both inside and outside traditional classrooms.
The event is free,
and you can [get tickets here][tickets].
We had a really good turnout last time,
and look forward to seeing you and your friends next week.
