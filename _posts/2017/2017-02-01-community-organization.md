Toronto-area tech folks (and others):
would you pay $300/head for a two-day weekend workshop on community organization
run here in the city by the [Midwest Academy](http://www.midwestacademy.com/)
(who have been training socially-progressive groups since the 1970s)?
And Toronto-area companies:
would you be willing to pay $600/head to send one of your staff
and sponsor someone who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend?
Please [let me know](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com?subject=community%20organization%20training).
