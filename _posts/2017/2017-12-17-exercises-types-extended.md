A couple of months ago,
I assembled [an incomplete list of automatically gradable exercises that can be used to teach programming]({{site.github.url}}/2017/10/16/exercise-types.html).
I think it would be useful to make this more comprehensive,
add citations to specific examples,
and then publish the result as a survey paper,
and am looking for co-authors who'd be interested in collaborating on it.
If you're faculty,
a K-12 teacher,
a graduate student,
or a developer building tools to do this,
and are interested in doing some research and writing starting in January,
please [give me a shout](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com?subject=Exercise%20types).
