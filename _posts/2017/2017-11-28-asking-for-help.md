My favorite tool is asking for help.
You may not think of it as a tool,
but it's something I use frequently to solve a wide range of problems,
so I think it qualifies.
Whether it's saying,
"I don't know what to do next â€“ does anyone have any ideas?" when teaching,
or cold-calling people
to see if they'll host a workshop,
asking for help has probably done more for me
than Emacs and version control combined.
