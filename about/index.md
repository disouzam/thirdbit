I was born in 1963 and grew up on [Vancouver Island](http://www.town.lakecowichan.bc.ca/),
where two inches of rain is considered a light shower.
I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Engineering at [Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca) in 1984,
then worked in Ottawa before moving to Edinburgh
to do an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 1985.
I spent the next six years working at the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/)
while doing a Ph.D. in Computer Science (which I completed in 1992)
and writing popular science articles for *The Independent* and [*New Scientist*](https://www.newscientist.com/).

Over the next few years
I wrote and edited my first few books
while doing post-doctoral work at several universities
and working at IBM, a data visualization startup, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
I became involved in open source development, particularly Python,
and started playing the saxophone and Ultimate frisbee (though not simultaneously).
From 2000 to 2004 I was a contributing editor with *Doctor Dobb's Journal*
and part of a computer security startup that was eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard.
I also published my first children's book and met the woman I'm married to,
and in 2007 we became the happy parents of a wonderful little troublemaker.

I was a professor in [Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/)
at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca) from 2007 to 2010,
during which time I helped create a [Master's degree in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/),
was named ComputerWorld Canada's "IT Educator of the Year",
and published some more books
(one of which, [*Beautiful Code*](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/),
won a Jolt Award in 2008).

I left academia in 2010
and spent the next seven years building [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org) into
a worldwide volunteer organization that teaches basic computing skills to thousands of researchers every year.
Somewhere in there I found time to edit
[a book on evidence-based software engineering](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)
and a multi-volume series called [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*](http://aosabook.org).
I stepped down from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) in January 2017,
and after a brief stint with [Rangle.io](http://rangle.io) I joined DataCamp,
who I'm proud to say [fired me in 2018](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup).

Most recently I spent two and a half years at [RStudio](http://rstudio.com),
where I ran the [instructor training and certification program](http://education.rstudio.com/trainers).
In my free time I worked on books like [*Teaching Tech Together*](http://teachtogether.tech),
[*JavaScript for Data Science*](http://js4ds.org),
and [*Research Software Engineering with Python*](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/),
and helped build TidyBlocks and [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/).
After a stint as Head of Education for [Metabase](http://www.metabase.com/),
I became a software engineering manager at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) in Toronto.
