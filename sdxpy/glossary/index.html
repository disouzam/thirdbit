Programmers generally put generic or reusable behavior in <a href="#parent_class">parent classes</a>, and more detailed or specific behavior in <a href="#child_class">child classes</a>.</dd>
<dt><span class="gl-key" id="class_method">class method</span></dt>

<dt><span class="gl-key" id="compiled_language">compiled language</span></dt>
<dd>Originally, a language such as C or Fortran that is translated into machine instructions for execution.

<dd>To find a function or a property of an <a href="#object">object</a> by name while a program is running.
