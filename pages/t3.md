We know as much about teaching and learning as we do about public health,
but most people in tech don't even know what we know.
A few basic ideas will help you build more effective lessons in less time and with less effort.
They will also make those lessons easier for people to find and reuse,
and help you figure out what impact they are having.

This one-day workshop introduces key evidence-based teaching techniques
that apply to onboarding new team members, technical support, and self-paced learning
as well as more formal training online or in the classroom.
Topics include:

-   creating learner personas
-   why novices, competent practitioners, and experts need different lessons
-   managing cognitive load
-   formative and summative assessment
-   what motivates and demotivates learners
-   teaching as a performance art
