<p>Shapers and Bots is a role-playing game
for children 8 and older inspired by <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>,
<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and every cartoon animal that ever walked
upright and wore clothes. The rules focus on storytelling rather
than realism: dice rolls are kept simple, and there are no
complicated tables showing how much damage a broadsword does
compared to a katana.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Centuries ago, the Makers created dozens of intelligent
species. Then they vanished, leaving behind a world full of
half-human creatures with strange powers, robots looking for their
next charge-up or repair, and a gathering evil that threaten
both.</p>
<p>In Shapers and Bots, you play a young animal adventurer or
newly-awoken bot in search of adventure. You can be a hero, a
rogue, or an outright villain, and can travel alone or with
companions. Your choices will determine how the game
unfolds.</p>
<h3>Some Notes on Numbers</h3>
<ol>
<li>When we want to describe the specific numbers shown on
dice, we will write them as <u>1</u>, <u>2</u>, and so on up to <u>6</u>.
When we talk about other numbers, such as the total score rolled on
three dice, we will write them as 7, 11, etc.</li>
<li>We sometimes write "3D+X" or "3D-X" to mean "the total on
three dice plus or minus X". For example, suppose we roll 3D+1; if
the three dice come up 2,
2, and 5, for a total
of 9, the final score is 10 (because of the +1).</li>
<li>If there are several bonuses or penalties, add them all
together. For example, if someone has a bonus of +3 on a roll and a
penalty of -4, their actual roll is 3D+3-4 or 3D-1, i.e., the total
on three dice minus one point.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Each game has one or more players
and a Director. Each player takes
on the role of one character, while the
Director plays all the other characters, who are called
extras. Before the game begins, the
Director will either create an adventure or find one that someone
else has created. Each player can create a character, or the
Director can create characters for them.</p>
<p>Once the game starts, each player decides what their
character does. When the player speaks, the character speaks in the
game world; when the player says, "I'm going to kick down the
door," their character tries to kick down the door. There are no
takebacks—you can't un-shoot an arrow—and if the
players spend two minutes arguing about what to do next, that's
what their characters are doing in the game world.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Every character has strengths and weaknesses that
determine what they're good at and what they aren't. We describe
this by giving every character a rating
for five features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size (abbreviated SIZ): how large the
character is. If the character is exceptionally short or
exceptionally skinny, the character may list height and weight
separately.</li>
<li>Fitness (FIT): how strong and coordinated
she is. Characters with a high fitness are good
athletes.</li>
<li>Dexterity (DEX): how good the character is
with her hands. This determines how well she can pick locks, play
musical instruments, or perform surgery.</li>
<li>Intelligence (INT): how good she is at book
learning and abstract reasoning. A character with a low Intellect
isn't stupid—she just isn't good at logic
puzzles.</li>
<li>Perception (PER): How well the character
notices things in their surroundings, which depends on eyesight,
hearing, sense of smell, and actually paying attention (which any
parent can tell you is very different from just seeing or hearing).
If the character has exceptionally good or bad eyesight, hearing,
or a sense of smell, they may have a separating rating for that,
just as they might for height and weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is a rating? It's simply a number: 0 if the
character is average, positive if they're higher than average, and
negative if they're lower. (A positive rating is sometimes called
a bonus, and a negative one is sometimes
called a penalty.)</p>
<p>Gertrude is big and healthy, so she has bonuses for Size
and Fitness, but she's not good with her hands, so she has a
penalty for Dexterity. Like most elephants she is somewhat
near-sighted, which means a penalty for Perception as well. Her
ratings are:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>SIZ +3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>FIT +1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>DEX -2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>INT 0</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>PER -1</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Strength</h3>
<p>Every character has one more feature called
Strength (abbreviated STR) which is the sum of
their Size and Fitness: big characters tend to be stronger than
small ones, but characters who aren't fit are not as strong as
characters who are.</p>
<p>Gertrude's strength is +4. Her cousin Norwin has a Size of
+4 (he's bigger than Gertrude) but a Fitness of -2 (he never
exercises), so his Strength is only +2.</p>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<p>If an extra is important to the plot—for example, if
they are a player character's sidekick—the Director may give
extras ratings for two more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courage (CRG): how brave the character
is.</li>
<li>Honesty (HON): how likely the character is
to tell the truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Player characters don't have ratings for these features
because being brave and telling the truth (or not) are part of the
game.</p>

<p>Yazzer hated how the breathing mask crushed his whiskers
against his face, and for the hundredth time wished that the air
tanks on his back weren't so heavy. But he had seen what the
fumes from the old chemical dump did to people's minds, and
he definitely didn't want to wind up like Skeez, who thought
that the trees whispered secrets no one else could hear.</p>
<p>A soft tick-tick-tick in the distance caught
Yazzer's ears. The rest of his crew was already back at the
wagon loading the bits of tech they had salvaged that day. There!
Something had definitely moved. He reached for the little crossbow
holstered against his leg, not knowing that it was already too
late…</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>A challenge is something a
character might want to do, like climb a wall or pick a lock. Every
challenge has a rating: difficult challenges have negative ratings
(which reduce the character's chance of success), while easy
challenges have positive ratings (which increase their
chances).</p>
<p>If a character tries to do a challenge, their player rolls
3D, totals the results, and then adds their character's
rating and the challenge's rating to the total. If the total is 10
or less, they have failed; on 11 or more, they have
succeeded.</p>
<p>Gertrude is trying to take apart the clockwork timer on a
small bomb. The challenge's rating is -1 (it's a little bit harder
than average) and her Dexterity is -2, so her roll is 3D-3. She
rolls 3 dice and gets 5,
4, and 2 for a total
of 11; after subtracting 1 for the difficulty and 2 for her poor
Dexterity, her total is only 8, so she has failed.</p>
<p>Panicking slightly, Gertrude decides to try smashing the
timer. The Director decides that the difficulty is 0 (it's neither
especially tough or particularly fragile). Gertrude's Strength is
+4, so she needs to get 11 or more on 3D+4. She rolls 3 dice and
gets a total of 11 points once again. After adding 4 for her
Strength her total is 15, and the delicate clockwork is now just
scrap metal.</p>
<p>If the total adjustment for a challenge (i.e., the
character's rating plus the challenge's difficulty) is positive,
and the outcome isn't critical to the game, the Director can decide
that the character gets an automatic
success. This rule helps keep the game
moving.</p>
<p>Gertrude wants to lift a crate of chocolates. Gertrude's
Strength is +4 and the challenge's difficulty is -1 (the crate is
larger than average, but not remarkably so). The total bonus is +3,
so the Director decides Gertrude's player can skip the dice
roll.</p>
<h3>Flukes and Fumbles</h3>
<p>Sometimes it may seem like a character has no chance at
all of doing something, but since Shapers and
Bots is a story-telling game, there is always
hope. If a player rolls 17 or 18 (that is,
5-6-6
or
6-6-6)
their character automatically succeeds, but probably not in the way
they expected. This is called a fluke
roll.</p>
<p>Zitter had never even seen a laser pistol sixty seconds
ago, but as the deranged one-eyed crocodile pirate charges toward
her, she picks up the one she just found and frantically starts
pushing buttons. The Director decides that finding the right
combination of buttons has a rating of -10. Zitter rolls three
sixes: somehow, her fumbling fingers land in the right places and
she puts a neat hole through the surprised crocodile.</p>
<p>A moment later, another crocodile comes around the corner,
sword in hand. Zitter rolls again and gets a score of 17. The
Director rules that her lucky shot has gone wild and brought a
branch crashing down between her and the angry pirate.</p>
<p>Fluke rolls work in reverse as well, because it's always
possible for something to go wrong. If a player rolls a total of 3
or 4 (that is,
1-1-1 or
1-1-2)
they automatically fail at whatever they were trying to do in some
hilarious, embarrassing, or fatal way. This is called a
fumble.</p>
<p>Another day, another angry crocodile pirate… Zitter
thinks she has figured out how to use her laser pistol, but when
she takes a shot, her player rolls
1-2-1 for
a total of 4 points—a fumble. "Self-destruct initiated", the
Director says in a mechanical voice. "Ten… nine…
eight…"</p>
<h2>Contests</h2>
<p>A situation in which one character is trying to outdo
another is called a contest. In this
case, both players roll dice and add their ratings, and whoever has
the higher score wins. If there is a tie, the Director rules on
whether the contest continues or whether something unusual
happened.</p>
<p>Gertrude and Norwin are arm-wrestling. Gertrude rolls 8;
her Strength is +4, so her score is 12. Norwin's Strength is +2; he
rolls 10, giving him a score of 12 as well, so the Director decides
that they are still locked in combat. When they re-roll, they both
get a total of 11. After adding their Strengths, Gertrude's score
is higher, so she wins.</p>

<p>"Why do I always get stuck with guard duty?"
Mushi thought resentfully, even though she knew it was because she
had the keenest eyes and ears in the team. Yazzer should have been
back half an hour ago, so everyone else had gone to look for him
and left her to guard the wagon full of scrap tech they had
salvaged. She hoped it would be enough to pay off the gang of
crocodiles who ran the local crime syndicate, but if it
wasn't—she hefted her bow. She wouldn't mind
seeing just how tough their scaly hides really were.</p>
<p>A soft tick-tick-tick in the distance made her perk up her
carefully-groomed ears. "Yaz?" she called. Nobody
answered. A chill ran up her spine as the last of the autumn leaves
crunched beneath a heavy footstep. Slowly, she drew an arrow and
notched it…</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Once a fight starts, everything happens in rounds that are
a few seconds long in game time. In each round, characters act in
order of Fitness, with highest Fitness going first. If two or more
characters are tied, their players roll 3D once at the start of the
fight to see who goes first for the duration of that
fight.</p>
<p>In each round, a character can take two actions. Each of
the following counts as one action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack someone.</li>
<li>Defend against an attack (discussed below).</li>
<li>Pick something up. (Dropping something doesn't count as
an action.)</li>
<li>Run from one place to another.</li>
<li>Draw a weapon.</li>
<li>Reload a weapon. This counts as one or more actions
depending on the type of weapon. For example, getting another arrow
from a quiver counts as one action (which means archers can fire
one shot per turn, since shooting counts as their other action).
Reloading a crossbow, on the other hand, requires several actions,
and so takes several rounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters can only attack once per round, even though
they have two actions.</p>
<p>For each attack, the attacker declares who or what they
are attacking, and the target says whether they are going to use
one of their actions for defense. If the defender isn't using an
action for defense, the attacker succeeds if they win a regular
roll. If the defender is using an action for defense, the attack
succeeds if the attacker makes their roll and the defender misses a
roll. This is different from a regular contest roll: the attacker
doesn't have to beat the defender's roll—the attacker has to
succeed and the defender has to fail.</p>
<p>Yoshi has a rating of +3 for fencing and her opponent Lin
has a rating of +1. Yoshi attacks first and rolls a total of 6.
Even with her +3 bonus, that's only 9, so she has missed and Lin
doesn't need to roll for defense.</p>
<p>Now it's Lin's turn. She rolls a total of 11; adding her
bonus of +1 gives her 12, so she has hit. Yoshi rolls 10; adding
her bonus gives 13, so she has parried the blow.</p>
<p>Yoshi attacks again in the next round. This time she rolls
12, for a total of 15—a hit! Lin rolls 5, for a measly total
of 6: her parry has failed, and she has been hit.</p>
<p>There are a few special cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the Director decides that an attack is a complete
surprise, the defender doesn't get a defense roll.</li>
<li>If the target hasn't had their turn yet, their defense
uses up an action for that round (i.e., if they defend themselves
against an attack, they can only use one other action when their
turn comes around).</li>
<li>If the target has already used all of their actions for
the round, they cannot defend themselves in that round. Going first
is therefore not as much of an advantage as you might think, since
smart players will save one action to use in defense.</li>
</ol>
<p>Flukes and fumbles count when attacking and defending: a
fluke attack always succeeds, while a fumble always misses. (If
someone gets a fluke when attacking and their opponent gets a fluke
when defending, the defense has succeeded.)</p>
<h2>Injury</h2>
<p>Every time a character is injured, their character must
win a challenge roll with their Strength
before the injury as a bonus and the amount
of the damage as a penalty. If they fail the roll, they have been
knocked out. Regardless of the roll's outcome, they lose that many
points of Strength because of the injury. A character dies when
their Strength goes negative (so someone with a Strength of -3 or
less won't survive a single hit).</p>
<p>Alouenne is a kangaroo with a Strength of +3. As the
tunnel collapses around her, she is hit by a falling rock that does
1 point of damage. She needs to win a roll with a +2 bonus to stay
conscious: +3 for her Strength before the injury and -1 for the
damage. She rolls 9 on 3D, giving her a score of 11. She has won
her roll, but the rock has injured her shoulder, and she is now
down to a Strength of +2.</p>
<p>A second piece of rock now drops on her head and does 2
points of damage. She needs to win a roll with no modifiers
(because +2 for her current Strength and -2 for the damage cancel
out). She rolls 7, so she fails and is knocked unconscious. She is
also now down to a Strength of 0.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>Since Shapers and Bots is a storytelling game, the
Director shouldn't let player characters die unless
there's no way around it (for example, they've fallen
into lava), it serves some dramatic purpose, or they deserve it
("Hey, I wonder if I can eat dynamite?"). For extras,
and for cases in which the Director doesn't want to be blamed
for the decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a character's strength drops to -4 or less,
they have succumbed to their injuries. This means that a character
with a Strength of -3 can be killed by a single blow, however
small, and that even strong characters can be taken out by a
sufficiently large one.</li>
<li>If a character is bleeding badly (for example, if their
injury was a sword cut), they take 1 more point of damage each
round unless someone successfully does first aid.</li>
<li>When a character is unconscious, an opponent can kill
them with a single blow—no roll is needed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>Someone who is knocked unconscious can try to regain
consciousness by winning a challenge roll with their Strength as a
bonus. It's up to the Director to decide how often they get to do
this.</p>
<p>While Gertrude is going through Alouenne's gear to see if
she has anything worth stealing, Alouenne's player rolls three dice
and gets 13. Regaining consciousness, Alouenne quietly reaches for
her dagger…</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>Weapons do damage (that's kind of the point), and bigger
weapons do more damage than little ones. To find out how much, the
attacker rolls the number of damage
dice shown below:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Weapon</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Dice</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Description</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Melee</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Punch, kick, headbutt, or thrown rock</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Small</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Knife or arrow (or a punch from someone with a black
belt)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Medium</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Sword, spear, ax, or pistol</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Large</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>4</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Two-handed sword, shotgun, or high-tech blaster</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Each 4, 5, or 6 counts as 1 point of damage (unless the
target is wearing armor, as discussed below).</p>
<p>Zephrod hits Gertrude with her ax. She rolls 3 dice and
gets 4, 2,
and 5, for 2 points of damage. Gertrude
counter-attacks with her knife and also hits. She rolls 2 dice and
gets 1 and
2: she has given Zephrod a superficial cut but
hasn't done any real damage.</p>
<h2>Armor</h2>
<p>Armor protects against damage. If someone is wearing Light
Armor, their attacker must roll a
5 or
6 on each die to do damage. If
they are wearing Heavy Armor, their attacker must roll a
6 for damage. For example,
suppose Gertrude had been wearing Light Armor in the fight above.
When Zephrod rolled 4,
2, and 5, she would
have done 1 point of damage rather than 2, because only the roll of
5 would have counted. If she had been wearing Heavy Armor she would
have taken no damage at all.</p>
<h2>Customizing Characters</h2>
<p>Animals of the same species can be quite different from
one another. When a player creates a character, they can spend a
total of 5 points raising the character's ratings. She can do this
by adding 2 points to two ratings and 1 point to a third, or by
adding 3 points to one rating and 1 each to two others, and so on,
so long as she doesn't raise any rating by more than 3
points.</p>
<p>Players can get extra points to distribute by lowering
ratings as well: they may lower any rating by 1 or 2 points, so
long as the total lowered is no more than 3 points.</p>
<p>Garree is a 15-year-old goat. Her default rating is zero
for everything, but her player decides to lower her Size by 1 point
and to distribute 6 points evenly across Fitness, Dexterity, and
Intellect:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>SIZ -1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>FIT +2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>DEX +2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>INT +2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>PER 0</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The same player makes different decisions for Garree's
brother Gruff. His Perception is reduced 2 points and his Intellect
by 1 point, which gives him 8 points to distribute to other
features.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>SIZ +3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>FIT +3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>DEX +2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>INT -1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>PER -2</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Every character has skills. Some
are automatic: for example, almost everyone can try to throw a
rock. Others are not: trust me, nobody can play the oboe if they've
never seen one before.</p>
<p>Just like features, skills have ratings. Positive ratings
mean that characters are better than average. negative ratings mean
that they find even simple tasks difficult. Some common skills are
listed below, along with a character's initial rating:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the initial rating is "None" the character has no
initial ability and must rely on fluke rolls to do
tasks.</li>
<li>If a number is given, the character starts with that
rating.</li>
<li>If a feature is given, the character's initial rating in
the skill is equal to their rating for that feature. For example,
every character's initial rating for Brawling is equal to their
Fitness.</li>
<li>If a formula is given, their initial rating is whatever
the formula calculates. For example, with Size -2 and Fitness +1,
their initial rating for Acrobatics is +3, which is Fitness minus
Size. (Being small is an advantage when doing flips and walking a
tightrope.)</li>
<li>If a skill is shown in bold,
it's worth writing down the character's rating even if
they haven't improved it, since these skills are used so
often in adventures.</li>

<h3>Choosing Skills</h3>
<p>When a player is creating a character, they can spend
INT+10 points improving the character's skills. For example, if a
character has an INT of +3, they have 13 points to spend on raising
skills. If their INT is -2, on the other hand, they only have 8
points to spend on skills (they're a slower learner).</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising a skill from None to -4 costs 1
point.</li>
<li>Each raise thereafter costs 1 point, up to a rating of
+3.</li>
<li>Every raise above a level of +3 costs 2
points.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Director may allow players to choose Skills that are
not in the master list. For example, piloting a hot air balloon is
different enough from Boating and Driving that the Director may
decide it's a skill in its own right.</p>
<h3>Leveling Up</h3>
<p>After each adventure, the Director may allow a player to
raise a skill they used in that adventure by one level. A player
may also find a teacher to help them learn a new skill. It is
usually pretty easy to find someone who can teach the lower levels
of common skills, though lessons may come at a price. Finding
someone who can teach a character how to raise a skill beyond +5
can be a quest in its own right.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<p>Every living character belongs to a
species. They all stand upright, speak, and have
hands, but they also have fur (or feathers) and their feet look
like animals' feet. Different species have different default values
for the seven features, which are shown below. All animals are
either vegetarian or omnivores; those marked as "carnivorous"
simply have a particularly strong liking for meat. Eating
intelligent animals is considered cannibalism.</p>
<h3>Bear</h3>
<p>Bears are deeply spiritual animals, apt to halt in the
middle of combat and ask, "But truly, what is the point of such
strife?" Of course, if you were this big, you could afford to be
philosophical too.</p>

<h2>Shaping</h2>
<p>A small number of animal characters have psychic powers
that let them control or
shape the world with their
mind. Characters who can shape typically start with a rating of -4,
which improves with practice and training. The six known kinds of
shaping are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth: dirt and stone. Very experienced
earth shapers can also shape metal.</li>
<li>Air: wind and sound.</li>
<li>Light: create (silent) illusions and wrap
themselves in shadows.</li>
<li>Water: in its liquid form. Very experienced
shapers can also shape ice. Using water shaping to control a living
creature is extremely difficult and also a serious
crime.</li>
<li>Luck: increase or decrease the chance of
something happening.</li>
<li>Time: slow things down or speed things up.
Nobody can stop time or reverse it, and nobody can see the future
(though unscrupulous time shapers sometimes pretend that they
can).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it is
extremely rare for someone to be able to do
more than one kind of shaping.</p>
<p>The Director decides case by case how hard it is to shape
something. If the shaper concentrates and does nothing else, common
tasks have the difficulties shown below.</p>

<p>Larrapin is an air shaper. Before her grandfather passed
away, he taught her what little he knew, so her score is -2 instead
of the default -4. She needs to distract some guards, so she
concentrates hard. Her player rolls 14, giving her a score of 12.
The guards hear a whispering voice somewhere in the bushes and go
to investigate it, giving Larrapin a chance to sneak into the
armory.</p>
<h2>Bots</h2>
<p>The Makers built bots to do everything from cleaning
windows to mining the ocean floor. Since they disappeared, the bots
have repaired themselves however they can to keep themselves going,
and made new bots whenever they can find the right parts. The
result is that no two bots look or think exactly alike. One might
have six short legs and a pair of mismatched claws for arms, while
another might use two rotor fans to fly, but have only a single
slender manipulator to pick things up.</p>
<p>Like living characters, bots start with 0 ratings for
Size, Fitness, Dexterity, and Intellect. A bot with low fitness is
probably rusty or missing parts, while one with high fitness looks
brand new (and will therefore be a target for other bots in need of
parts).</p>
<p>Bots' Perception is also 0 by default, but only a few bots
have any sense of smell. (Most think smell is gross and wish living
creatures wouldn't talk about it so much.)</p>
<p>Bots naturally have Light Armor. By default, every robot
character has either tracks, wheels, or legs to move with, two arms
(which don't have to match), cameras, a microphone (for hearing),

<p>Its official designation was Thirty-Ack Forty-Four, but it
had long ago decided to call itself the Toxicator. It did not know
why the Makers had wanted this site guarded. It did not need to
know: that was its mission, and anyone or anything that interfered
with that mission was just a problem to be solved.</p>
<p>Right now it had two such problems, both furry, cautious,
