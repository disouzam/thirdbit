This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
typeset with [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)
and [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-code-pro),
and checked with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/).
The theme's colors are taken from these classic Canadian stamps:

<div class="center">
  <img src="{{'/files/stamps.jpg' | relative_url}}" width="50%"/>
</div>
