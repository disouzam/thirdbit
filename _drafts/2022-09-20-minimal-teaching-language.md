Pascal was my second programming language,
and its design has influenced every piece of code I've ever written
and every recommendation I've ever made about how to learning to program.
In the early 2000s Python 2 had the same balance of simplicity and expressivity,
and was an even better first language than Pascal had been.
I can't say the same about Python 3, though:
the additions that make it more useful for large-scale production work
have made it less approachable for beginners.
("Ignore the features you don't need yet" doesn't work,
since searches on Stack Overflow almost immediately lead novices
to concepts they aren't yet ready to understand.)

I am therefore very interested in languages like [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
and [Wren](https://wren.io/)
that have chosen to stay small.
I looked at several of these while working on
[*Software Design by Example*](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
and wrote up a list of features I need to teach software design.
I'd be grateful for feedback on two things:

1.  Which ones you _don't_ think you need to teach
    a first-year introduction to programming,
    an introductory course on data structures and algorithms,
    and an upper-year course on software design.

1.  What _one_ feature (emphasis deliberate) you would add to this list
    and why?
