As [I wrote two weeks ago][file_archiver],
two things led me to write the [JavaScript][sdxjs] and [Python][sdxpy] versions of
*Software Design by Example*:
Mary Rose Cook's [Gitlet][gitlet]
and the question, "How does a debugger work?"
Earlier chapters addressed the first,
and this,
the last technical chapter in [this book][sdxpy],
addresses the second.

I've complained many times over more than two decades about the fact that
universities don't teach debugging as a first-class skill,
and that while there are hundreds of books on how to write compilers,
I've only ever found three that explained how to write a debugger
(none of which were particularly good).
Showing people how to create and manage breakpoints isn't going to fix that,
but I'm glad I had a chance to do what I could.
