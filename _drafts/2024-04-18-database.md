One of the joys of writing is learning new things yourself in order to explain them to others.
[Chapter 18: A Database][sdxpy_db] was more joyful than most,
though it didn't feel that way at the time.
I knew at the outset that a relational database using B-trees wouldn't fit in my one-hour limit,
so I started reading about log-structured databases.
Once my head stopped swimming I tried to build one,
and quickly realized that if I wanted it to be manageable
I would have to ignore the same issues around atomic multi-file operations
that I ignored in the chapter on [a file archiver][sdxpy_archive].
I thought I would come back to them,
but time, interest, and space all ran out;
if there's ever a sequel to [this book][sdxpy],
I hope that will be its first chapter.
