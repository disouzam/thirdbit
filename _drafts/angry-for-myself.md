Years ago, I overheard a grownup trying to calm down a child who was holding back tears.
Didn't hear what the grownup said,
but the child replied, "I'm not feeling sorry for myself, I'm feeling _angry_ for myself!"
When the adult said something soothing,
the child said, "But it wasn't _fair_!"

I don't know what "it" was,
but I know exactly what the kid meant.
I hope they never stopped being angry for themself
when the world gave them good reason to.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not,
be damned with you.
