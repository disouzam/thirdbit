I supervised almost 200 senior undergraduates' projects at the University of Toronto
between 2002 and 2010.
Based on that experience I wrote a student's guide to developing software in teams.
I revised it several years later
to try to make it relevant to scientists without a background in computer science
who found themselves building large libraries and applications for research,
but in the end I decided not to publish it:
I didn't think the world needed another bunch of "just so" stories from one person's point of view,
and none of my attempts to talk other teachers into contributing went anywhere.

Then Trump became president,
in part because tech companies thought race hate and conspiracy theories were OK
as long as they improved engagement.
In 2017 I tried to get a bunch of people in tech to write a chapter each
to explain why the United States incarcerates more people than any other country in the world,
why no one from the Sackler family ever went to prison for selling opioids that killed tens of thousands of people,
and how Silicon Valley managed to persuade us all that mass surveillance was OK.
That effort eventually ground to a halt:
we didn't know enough of this stuff ourselves to teach it,
and most of the people who did seemed more interested in impressing each other
than in making their thinking accessible to newcomers
who weren't yet sure it would be useful.

The second point was and is the most important.
[Software Carpentry][carpentries],
[It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit],
and [*Teaching Tech Together*][t3] were all attempts to give people
a [ball-and-stick model][balls-and-sticks] that would help them understand the world right away,
and that they could build on *if they wanted to*.
I didn't realize it at the time,
but what I wanted was [Scratch for the social sciences][scratch-social-sciences]:
something that would help people understand fundamental ideas
without requiring the hours and hours (and hours) of slogging and disillusionment
of "the real thing"
Unfortunately,
people who already understood these ideas in depth
were as dismissive of dumbing them down [sic]
as programmers are of tools like Scratch.

Six years, four books, and one pandemic later,
I think it's more important than ever to find a way to explain how the world actually works
to young programmersâ€”more specifically,
to [young, white or Asian, cis het male, physically able, economically secure programmers][seeing-like-a-student]
who are mostly OK with how the world works right now
and don't see why they should rock the boat.
Their software engineering courses typically include a lecture or two about professional ethics;
for the most part they nod,
say what they know they're supposed to on the assignment,
and go back to re-telling each other lines from the latest episode of Joe Rogan's show.
Their "business of software" course explains how VC-backed startups work,
but definitely doesn't talk about labor rights or unionization,
and if it did,
I suspect they would once again nod,
tell us what we want to hear,
and carry on as they were.

Which brings us to [*Building Tech Together*][btt].
It is currently an uncomfortable and out-of-touch mix of
technology ("how to use Git with other people"),
process ("how to run an effective meeting"),
and polemic ("how preparatory privilege keeps power in the hands of those who have it").
It doesn't draw nearly enough on recent research on [developer thriving][thriving]
and doesn't even try to describe alternatives to Silicon Valley's [self-justifying bullshit][leadership-bs].

I think it could, though.
I think that (for example) an explanation of how to run more effective meetings
could segue into a discussion of the way that [who interrupts whom][interruptions]
depends on perceived or desired social status,
which would in turn give students tools for looking at other social situations more clearly.
The same ["bait-and-switch for good" approach][first-six-questions]
has a better chance of getting [the unconverted][unconverted]
to pay attention than anything else I can think of.
For example,
an analysis of how (not) to do [performance reviews][perf-reviews]
could easily turn into a discussion of how students in a team project should be evaluated,
which in turn could lead to discussion of how to design safeguards against sociopathic teammates and Elon Musk.

[I don't know enough to write this on my own][ultracrepidarian],
and most of the people I know are in the same boat:
when I asked recently for suggestions about [a new programming stack][new-stack]
and [teaching team leadership][and-now-to-lead],
thirty-one people offered ideas about the former
and none about the latter.
I could continue trying to learn enough on my own
and then turn [*BTT*][btt] into something like [*T3*][t3],
but nobody has ever been willing to back proposals like [these][leadership-skills] [two][org-change],
and there aren't as many years or words in front of me as there are behind me.

On the other hand,
[I'm still angry][why-i-teach].
I've read eight books on how to be an engineering manager in the last sixteen months,
and *none* of them have talked about
what to do when your employer is [helping white supremacists stay in business][shopify]
or [tries to cover up a case of sexual assault][datacamp].
It's been a privilege to spend so many years thinking and writing about [teaching][t3] and [software][sdxjs] [design][sdxpy],
but I think that with great privilege comes great responsibility,
and that if I don't accept that responsibility,
[I'm the asshole][aita].
I don't know what to do next,
but if you'd like to help,
[I'd like to hear from you](mailto:{{site.author.email}}).

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.
