Many programmers believe they're more likely to write documentation and keep it up to date
if it is close to the code.
Tools that extract specially-formatted comments from code and turn them into documentation
have been around since at least the 1980s;
[Chapter 16][sdxjs_doc] of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs]
builds on discussion in earlier chapters of [turning code into a data structure][sdxjs_checker]
to extract Markdown from comments and turn it into HTML.

While tools like this are useful,
I wish they didn't need to exist.
Instead,
I wish our languages would allow us to write things like:

```
const name = (args) => {
    ...do things...
}
with documentation {
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
    [[consectetur]] adipiscing elit,
    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
    et dolore magna aliqua.
}
```

where the names of parameters and other functions are automatically cross-linked
and `[[...]]` or some similar syntax creates an external link and so on.
[doctest][doctest]-style tests could be put in another block,
and I'm sure people would find other uses for this as well.
In a better world than thisâ€¦
