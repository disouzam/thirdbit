Another year over; what have I learned?

- I'd successfully avoided management for two decades,
  but my luck finally ran out:
  I was "promoted" to engineering manager at [Deep Genomics][dg].

- The lightning talks that we organized for [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit]
  went very well;
  it was a pleasure to work with [Mike Hoye][hoye] and [Brittany Johnson][johnson].

- [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs] was published.
  I'm working on [the Python version][sdxpy] right now,
  but suspect it will be my last technical book:
  people aren't reading them,
  and there are stories I want to write.

- I published "[Twelve quick tips for software design][12-design]".

- We spent a long weekend in Montréal,
  which was our first family trip since the start of lockdown.
  I'd forgotten how beautiful the city can be in the spring…

- We went to BC in July to have a much-delayed service for [my mum][mum],
  but came down with COVID on the second day and had to cancel almost everything.

- Favorite book: either [*Honeycomb*][honeycomb] by Joanne Harris
  or [*The Final Girl Support Group*][final-girl] by Grady Hendrix.

- Favorite movie: [*Everything Everywhere All at Once*][everything].
  We watched it in a Vancouver hotel room one night, sick with COVID,
  and it was exactly what we needed.

- Favorite album: didn't find anything new this year that particularly excited me.

- Favorite moments: sharing dad jokes with my wife and daughter
  whether they wanted me to or not.
