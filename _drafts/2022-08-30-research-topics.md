compare time-to-understand with and without UML or other notations
how much do developers know about cognitive psychology and/or social psychology? what mistruths and urban myths do they believe?

apply security analysis techniques to peer review models
compare-and-contrast Markdown-ish tools for building documentation and/or tutorials
follow-up to https://programming-journal.org/2017/1/17/

adoption of fixes to git interface (e.g. git switch) over time
correlation between README length and usage stats: https://twitter.com/teabass/status/884708605441843200
does it help to have one operator for defining variables and another for updating them?
how and when do people migrate between open source projects?
how often do devs do performance profiling, how do they do it?
how often are ESE findings mentioned in SE courses (not textbooks)? which ones?
score ICSE papers against "Analyze That!"
how do people physically organize lessons when using Markdown-ish compilers?
things like Sajaniemi's roles of variables for refactoring steps or test cases or...
roles of columns (like roles of variables)
follow-up to https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3230977.3230986
how does team size affect the proportion of time spent planning and its accuracy?
update of new CSS features over time
correlation between quality of error messages and community quality
analyze data from a dozen projects, then try to guess which ones think they're doing agile and which aren't. Compare it to what team members tell you they're doing. See if there's anything more than weak correlation
what is taught about debugging after first year?
Can we assess students' proficiency with tools by watching screencasts of their work? And can we do it efficiently enough to make it a feasible way to grade how they code (as well as the code they write)?
altruism in software teams: how to detect it, what's the effect?

Embedded code chunks in OpenOffice: https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/1159857430219644929
when people write essay-length explanations like https://beepb00p.xyz/mypy-error-handling.html and https://fly.io/blog/sqlite-internals-wal/, what do they explain and how?
has anyone done a study that plots when people get funded on a loose timeline of "building a startup"? like if 0 is idea and 100 is fully functioning company, where do most black/brown founders get funded vs. other poc founders vs. white founders?
prevalence of pseudoscience (e.g., Myers-Briggs) in tech hiring
analyze videos of coding clubs: are girls treated differently than boys by instructors?
how does the distribution of language constructs actually used in large programs vary by language? e.g., repeat https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1211039070152880128 for programming languages
calculate a Gini coefficient for how effectively scientists use computing, I think you'd find the inequality is steadily increasing: the most proficient are getting better but the vast majority haven't budged in 25 years.
1. Train a Markov text generator on your software's documentation. 2. Generate some fake man pages. 3. Give users a mix of real & fake pages and see if they can tell them apart.
How does the number of (active) Slack channels in an org grow as a function of time or of the number of employees?
how well do the abstracts of SE research papers summarize actual findings?
what do tech support staff informally teach during tech support calls?
I wish there was a simple, standard, widely-supported notation like CSS selectors for selecting parts of a program to display in tutorials. I've used five (six?) tools based on specially-formatted comments with various publishers, and it's getting tired
how does the order in which people write code for production differ from the order in which they explain code in a tutorial and why?
