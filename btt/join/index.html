      <p>Hundreds of books have been published about how to start a tech business,
and works like <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Fogel2020">Fogel2020</a>]</span> have a lot of advice
on setting up and running open source projects.
Much less has been written about how to join existing projects,
even though that&rsquo;s what most people do most of the time.
If your course has you joining an open source project,
or if you are the new person on a team at work,
these rules can help.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Search first.</dt>
<dd>Whatever question you have,
the odds are pretty good that someone has asked it before,
opened an issue about it,
or discussed it in the project chat.
If the project is well organized
it should only take a minute to find out (<span class="fixme">see&nbsp;FIXME</span>),
and if you mention what you searched for when you do ask a question,
people will probably point you in the right direction when they answer.</dd>
<dt>But do ask.</dt>
<dd>The biggest mistake newcomers make
is to spend hours looking for something rather than asking a question.
If you have searched but haven&rsquo;t found anything helpful,
it&rsquo;s OK to take a minute of someone else&rsquo;s time,
especially if you post your question
where the answer can be found by the next newcomer.</dd>
<dt>Remember that software is only one part of a project.</dt>
<dd>There are many ways to contribute to a software project.
Updating or translating documentation and testing bug fixes
are good places to start;
they will also help you learn your way around and make you friends.</dd>
<dt>Respect what has already been done.</dt>
<dd>If the first thing you do when you walk into someone&rsquo;s home is say,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d redecorate,&rdquo;
you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to be invited back.
Follow the project&rsquo;s existing coding conventions
even if you prefer something else.
Use existing tags for issues <span class="fixme">see&nbsp;FIXME</span>,
and don&rsquo;t introduce yourself
by suggesting that they rearchitect the code or change languages.</dd>
<dt>Be patient.</dt>
<dd>It took me almost three months of full-time work
to get up to speed in my  current job,
and the first contributor to the Python scripts used to build this book
needed a couple of evenings to find their way around.
Depending on the size, age, and organization of the project you&rsquo;re joining,
you should expect it to have to invest this much time
before you feel productive.
You will always look back and say,
&ldquo;I could have done this so much more quickly.&rdquo;
You will always be wrong.</dd>
<dt>Start small.</dt>
<dd>This is a corollary of the previous three points.
As you learn your way around a project socially as well as technologically,
you will build a mental model of how it works (Chapter&nbsp;7).
Offering a small contribution is a way to test that mental model.
Do you understand the application&rsquo;s architecture?
Do you know where tests are supposed to go and how review and merging work?
A three-line change to documentation is a more cost-effective way to test this
than three hundred lines of new code that completely misses the mark.</dd>
<dt>Keep exploring.</dt>
<dd>Thousands of books have been written about how to write code,
but only a few explain how to read it
(<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Spinellis2003">Spinellis2003</a>]</span> being my favorite).
However,
reading other people&rsquo;s code is one of the best ways to learn
how to be a better programmer,
while browsing a project&rsquo;s issues
can give you even more insight into why the code works the way it does
(and where and why it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> work).
If you feel that this is a less productive use of your time than coding,
think about how much time musicians spend
listening to each other or how much artists look at each other&rsquo;s work.
See <span class="fixme">see&nbsp;FIXME</span> for more on this.</dd>
<dt>Get to know people.</dt>
<dd>There is a softball team here in Toronto that practices every Thursday
but hasn&rsquo;t played an actual game in twenty years.
As with many groups,
their ostensible reason for existing
is just an excuse for people who like each other to hang out.
A lot of projects are like that:
participants get satisfaction from working with one another
as well as from what they produce.
While your job won&rsquo;t ever love you back <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Jaffe2021">Jaffe2021</a>]</span>,
the relationships you make with the people you work beside
may be as rewarding as the software you build.</dd>
<dt>Remember that most relationships don&rsquo;t end in marriage.</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s OK to do a little work on an open source project
and then decide if it&rsquo;s for you or not.
It&rsquo;s equally OK to look for a new job if you&rsquo;re not happy with the one you&rsquo;re in:
after all,
most companies wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to eliminate your job if they needed to cut costs.
Don&rsquo;t let anyone manipulate you by making you feel guilty about this.</dd>
<dt>Share what you learn.</dt>
<dd>If you aren&rsquo;t the first person to join a project,
you probably won&rsquo;t be the last.
One of the most compassionate things you can do
is share what you found out as you were learning your way around
so that the next person can do so more quickly.
Doing this also helps you figure out what you know now
that you didn&rsquo;t know then,
which can help you learn faster the next time you&rsquo;re the new person.</dd>

<h3>Buddies and mentors</h3>
<p>A well-run project&rsquo;s process for getting newly-hired people up to speed
can be anything from a simple checklist
to a multi-week sequence of courses.
However it&rsquo;s done,
it is most effective when new people are paired with buddies or mentors
to direct their first questions to,
and who will check in with them regularly to see how they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
