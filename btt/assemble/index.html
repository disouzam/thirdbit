      <p>I once heard an anthropologist ask,
&ldquo;How big is a sports team?&rdquo;
When people said it depends on the sport,
she explained that in fact they all have about half a dozen members.
Anything larger than that splits into smaller groups:
the forwards and backs in rugby,
the infield and outfield in baseball,
and so on.
She went on to explain that
hunting parties in non-agricultural societies are usually that size as well,
as are the basic military units around the world
(a platoon is two squads of six people).
Since we can only keep a handful of things in our short-term memory at once (Chapter&nbsp;7),
that&rsquo;s as big as a team can practically be.</p>
<p>The same applies to software development.
Three or four people can work tightly on a single piece of code,
but when there are more they have to define interfaces
so that they can develop in parallel.</p>
<p>Teams of three to five provide a good balance between skills and accountability.
A team of two may not have enough breadth and background
to tackle a large piece of work;
more importantly,
one or the other person is likely to take a dominant role.
If you put more than half a dozen people in a single team,
on the other hand,
you may not be able to divide up the work
in a way that will keep everyone engaged and busy.
Large teams also make scheduling meetings much more difficult,
and increase the odds that at least one member will be a hitchhiker.</p>
<p>Many students prefer to select their teammates,
and students with high grades tend to want teammates with a similar profile.
However,
having students with a range of grades in the same team
either has no effect or improves outcomes <em>for everyone</em>
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Mosher2013">Mosher2013</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Donovan2018">Donovan2018</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Farland2019">Farland2019</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Auvinen2020">Auvinen2020</a>]</span>.
It&rsquo;s easy to see how this benefits teams of weak students:
they are likely to get coaching from their stronger teammates.
One theory for why it also helps stronger students is that
the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else;
bringing a weaker teammate up to speed
will usually do more for your grade
than spending those same hours hacking or reading.</p>
<p>In my experience,
teams of strong students are more likely to use a divide-and-conquer strategy,
effectively reducing the project to
a set of parallel sub-projects handled by one person each.
This may feel more efficient,
but most of the benefits of working in a team are lost:
there&rsquo;s less back-and-forth discussion of design issues
and little improvement in communication skills.
Those may not be important to you at first,
but if there is a final exam in your course with questions about the project work,
your mark on it may depend on how much you know about your teammates&rsquo; work
(Chapter&nbsp;8).</p>
<p>The most powerful argument for instructors allocating people to teams,
though,
is that&rsquo;s how it works in the real world <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Oakley2004">Oakley2004</a>]</span>.
You probably won&rsquo;t get to pick your colleagues
if you join a company or an academic research group.
Instead,
you&rsquo;ll be put on a project
and expected to work well with whoever else is on it.
Your performance will depend as much on your ability to get along with others
as it will on your raw technical ability,
so you might as well start practicing those skills now.</p>
<p>If instructors create teams,
they should avoid isolating at-risk students.
Women and members of racialized minority groups
are more likely to drop out of computer science than other students,
particularly in first and second year,
and one of the main reasons is feeling isolated or out of place.
Research has shown that putting at-risk students together in the first couple of years
can mitigate this problem <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Margolis2002">Margolis2002</a>]</span>.
It is less necessary in upper years,
since by then students have a stronger commitment to whatever program they&rsquo;re in,
but it still helps to prevent some of the problems discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>The biggest headache when instructors select teams is scheduling.
COVID-19 made distributed work more normal,
but the last university I taught at had three campuses spread across a large metropolitan area,
and some students commuted an hour and a half each way to get to classes.
Instructors should therefore take students&rsquo; schedules into account when forming teams.
If the class is small,
the simplest way is
to get each student to fill in a weekly timesheet showing when they&rsquo;re available
and then group people who have large blocks of overlap.
If the class is larger,
a web-based calendaring tool may be easier.
I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> suggest trying to use whatever software the university uses
to figure out course timetables:
although that usually doesn&rsquo;t scale down to in-class scheduling.</p>
<p>Another factor to take into account is that
some people are early birds while others are night owls.
Putting the two on the same team pretty much guarantees that someone will miss meetings,
or sleep through them,
no matter when they&rsquo;re held.
Simply asking people,
&ldquo;Do you prefer to work in the morning or the evening?&rdquo;
can be surprisingly effective.</p>
<p>However you form teams,
each team should have at least one block of two hours
to work together each week outside of class.
Teams should also try to find a second block
that&rsquo;s half an hour long
for a weekly status meeting (Chapter&nbsp;3).
Try to keep the two blocks separate
so that it&rsquo;s clear to everyone when they&rsquo;re supposed to be talking about the project
and when they&rsquo;re supposed to be doing design,
writing code,
testing,
and so on.
If the two are scheduled back-to-back,
the meeting will drag on into working time or vice versa.</p>
