      <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <div class="tagline"><p>What this book talks about and why.</p></div>
  <ul class="syllabus">
<li>Our goal is to help you become a compassionate programmer.</li>
<li>Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.</li>
<li>We know more about programs, programmers, and programming from empirical studies than most people realize.</li>
<li>Good programmers aren&rsquo;t ten times more productive than average, but it&rsquo;s fair to say they are four times better.</li>
</ul>


      <p>Programming is often portrayed as a solitary activity,
but real applications are always the work of many people.
The aim of this book is therefore to show you
how to build software as part of team.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help you become a <em>compassionate programmer</em>:
one who cares about the wellbeing of their colleagues,
their users,
and society as a whole.
This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others
also helps your future self—but now that we know how much harm software can do,
we need to build it better.</p>
<h2 id="intro-audience">Audience</h2>
<p>This book can be read on its own or as a companion to <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Wilson2022">Wilson2022</a>]</span>.
(If you are looking for a course project,
please consider adding a tool to the ones it covers.)
These three learner personas describe who this book is for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Yani</em> is in the third year of a computer science degree.
    She worked on several volunteer projects in high school and through her mosque,
    but the &ldquo;Introduction to Software Engineering&rdquo; course she&rsquo;s about to take
    will be the first time she has built software with other people.
    This book will help her and her teammates figure out who should do what, when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Brad</em> is in Yani&rsquo;s class.
    He started programming when he was nine years old,
    and can do many assignments in half the time it takes other students.
    (He attributes this to natural aptitude
    rather than to his parents being able to afford to send him to after-school coding camps).
    He finds discussion of what he calls &ldquo;fluffy stuff&rdquo; tiresome;
    this guide will help him understand why that attitude is self-defeating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sharla</em> has taught that software engineering class twice.
    Each time,
    they came away feeling that
    their students had wasted time on things that weren&rsquo;t useful
    and hadn&rsquo;t learned things that would be.
    This book will help them restructure that course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intro-theme">Themes</h2>
<p>Much of what&rsquo;s hard about building software stems from
the way our brains work <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hermans2021">Hermans2021</a>]</span>.
One theme of this book is therefore
this modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution">Dobzhansky&rsquo;s Rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another theme is that
we know a lot more about software and how to build it
than most people realize.
Empirical studies of programs, programmers, and programming date back more than fifty years,
but their findings are rarely discussed in undergraduate classes.
As a result,
most books on how to program are a mix of personal experience and received wisdom,
which is usually just someone else&rsquo;s personal experience repackaged as a universal truth.
We therefore cite research findings to back up our claims where we can.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h3>Why does everything take so long?</h3>
<p><span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Sedano2017">Sedano2017</a>]</span> found that software development projects have nine types of waste:
building the wrong feature or product,
mismanaging the backlog,
rework,
unnecessarily complex solutions,
extraneous cognitive load (Chapter&nbsp;18),
psychological distress,
waiting and multitasking,
knowledge loss,
and ineffective communication.
<em>None of these are software issues,</em>
so if you only think about the code in your project and not about the people writing it,
everything will take longer and hurt more than it needs to.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="intro-example">An Example</h2>
<p>People sometimes talk about 10X programmers—ones who are
ten times more productive than average—but do they actually exist?
To find out,
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Prechelt2000">Prechelt2000</a>]</span> looked at how long it took eighty programmers
to solve the same problem in the language of their choice.
Their times (in hours) are shown as a whisker plot in <a class="fig-ref" href="#intro-prechelt">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<figure id="intro-prechelt">
<img src="./prechelt-development-time.svg" alt="Box-and-whisker plot show that most developers spent between zero and 20 hours but a few took as long as 63 hours."/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure&nbsp;1: Distribution of development times.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The shortest and longest development times were 0.6 and 63 hours respectively,
giving a ratio of 105X.
However,
the subjects used seven different languages;
if we only look at those who used Java (about 30% of the whole)
the shortest and longest times are 3.8 and 63 hours,
giving a ratio of &ldquo;only&rdquo; 17X.</p>
<p>But comparing the best and the worst of anything gives us
an exaggerated impression of the difference.
If we compare the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile
we get a ratio of 18.5/7.25 or 2.55;
if we compare the 90th percentile to the 50th we get 3.7,
and other comparisons give us other values.
As <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Prechelt2019">Prechelt2019</a>]</span> explains,
the best answers to our original question are therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>good programmers aren&rsquo;t 10 times more productive than average;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but it&rsquo;s reasonable to say that they are about four times more productive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intro-why">Why This Book?</h2>
<p>Three books changed my life as a programmer.
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Kernighan1981">Kernighan1981</a>]</span> taught me I could do more than just write software—I could <em>design</em> it—while
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Glass2002">Glass2002</a>]</span> taught me we could study software and software development scientifically
to determine what actually works (or doesn&rsquo;t).
In between them I read <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hunt1999">Hunt1999</a>]</span>;
for many programmers of my generation,
it was the first thing that described the craft of software construction
in a way that made sense.</p>
<p>I referred to those books over and over again
when I started teaching at the University of Toronto in the early 2000s,
but re-reading them now,
I&rsquo;m struck by what they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> discuss.
How do you run a meeting in a way that ensures everyone is heard?
After forty years in tech,
I believe that is the most important skill I ever learned.
How and why does tech marginalize women,
people of color,
and members of the LGBT community?
And given how software is being used to amplify hate for profit
in ways that threaten us all,
shouldn&rsquo;t every guide to being a better programmer at least mention the problem?</p>
<p>The books I read when I was young didn&rsquo;t even ask these questions;
neither do newer ones like <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Larson2019">Larson2019</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Orosz2023">Orosz2023</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Thomas2019">Thomas2019</a>]</span>.
This book can&rsquo;t answer them all,
but I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy a little practical idealism.</p>
