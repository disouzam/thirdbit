      <p>The most valuable part of your project isn&rsquo;t the software you write, or the
grade you&rsquo;re given: it&rsquo;s the retrospective.
Some teams call this a &ldquo;post mortem&rdquo;,
which is literally an examination of a deceased person;
in a software project,
it&rsquo;s a look back at what went right and what went wrong.</p>
<p>The aim of a retrospective is to help the team and its members do better next time
by giving everyone a chance to reflect on what they&rsquo;ve just accomplished. It is
<em>not</em> to shame people, but it can be hard to critique someone&rsquo;s work without
them taking it personally, so retrospectives add a few extra rules to the ones
introduced for meetings in Chapter&nbsp;3:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Get a moderator who wasn&rsquo;t part of the project.</dt>
<dd>Someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a stake in the project should run the meeting.
Otherwise, the meeting will either go in circles, or focus on only a subset
of important topics. In the case of student projects, this moderator might
be the course instructor, or (if the course is too large) a TA.  You can
have another student as moderator, but since they are probably friends with
some team members, it may be hard for them to be objective.</dd>
<dt>Set aside an hour, and <em>only</em> an hour.</dt>
<dd>In my experience, nothing useful is said in the first ten minutes of anyone&rsquo;s
first retrospective, since people are naturally a bit shy about praising or
damning their own work. Equally, nothing useful is said after the first
hour: if you&rsquo;re still talking, it&rsquo;s probably because one or two people have
a <em>lot</em> they want to get off their chests.</dd>
<dt>Require attendance.</dt>
<dd>Everyone who was part of the project ought to be in the room for the post
mortem. This is more important than you might think: the people who have the
most to learn from the retrospective are often least likely to show up if the
meeting is optional.</dd>
<dt>Make two lists.</dt>
<dd>Put the headings &ldquo;Keep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Change&rdquo; on the board, then do a lap around the
room and ask every person to give me one item that hasn&rsquo;t already been
mentioned for each list.  The &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t already been mentioned&rdquo; part is
important: after the first few safe responses are up on the board, people
have to start saying the more difficult things that really matter.</dd>
<dt>Comment on actions rather than individuals.</dt>
<dd>Don&rsquo;t let tension between teammates sidetrack the meeting: if someone has a
specific complaint about another member of the team, require them to
criticize a particular event or decision. &ldquo;They had a bad attitude&rdquo; does
<em>not</em> help anyone improve their game.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once everyone&rsquo;s thoughts are out in the open, organize them somehow so that you
can make specific recommendations about what to do next time.  For example, here
are the recommendations that came out of one retrospective I did with students:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do a better job of tracking actual progress, rather than reported progress.
    Maybe require a one-minute demo every time a feature is marked &ldquo;complete&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams should find one block of 2&ndash;3 hours per week when they can work side
    by side: IM meetings and email resulted in a lot of dropped balls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having someone who worked on the project in the previous term come in to get
    the new team up to speed made a huge difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue tracking system was too complicated for students&rsquo; needs: really just
    want a shared online to-do list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams should have to report test coverage at every progress meeting to make
    sure that a lot of untested code doesn&rsquo;t pile up during the term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout">
<h3>Pay it forward</h3>
<p>Ask your instructor at the start of your course for copies of the retrospectives
written by previous student teams.  Go through and pick out some common themes,
then use them as a list of things to do or avoid in your own project.  Sharing
what you&rsquo;ve learned with those who come after you is the most compassionate
thing you can do.</p>
