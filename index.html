<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Years ago I lost my temper while arguing with my brother and said,
"Jeff, I could teach you everything I know and you'd still be an idiot."
Please keep that in mind as you read this site.</p>

<div align="center">
<p>
  {% for b in site.books %}
  <a href="{{b.url}}"><img src="{{b.cover | prepend: '/files/' | relative_url}}" alt="{{b.title}}" class="book-cover" /></a>
  {% endfor %}
</p>
</div>
