![Greg Wilson]({{site.github.url}}/files/gvwilson-toque-2013.jpg)

I was born in 1963 and grew up on [Vancouver Island](http://www.town.lakecowichan.bc.ca/),
where two inches of rain is considered a light shower.
I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Engineering at [Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca) in 1984,
then worked in Ottawa before moving to Edinburgh
to do an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence in 1985.
I spent the next six years working at the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/)
while doing a Ph.D. in Computer Science (which I completed in 1992)
and writing popular science articles for *The Independent* and [*New Scientist*](https://www.newscientist.com/).

Over the next few years
I wrote and edited my first few books
while doing post-doctoral work at several universities,
and working at IBM, a data visualization startup, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
I also became involved in open source development (particularly Python)
and started playing the saxophone and Ultimate frisbee (though not simultaneously).
Between 2000 and 2004 I was part of a computer security startup
that was eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard,
a contributing editor with *Doctor Dobb's Journal*,
and an adjunct professor at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca).

I was a professor in [Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/)
at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca) in from 2007-2010,
during which time I wrote some more books
(one of which, [*Beautiful Code*](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/),
won a Jolt Award in 2008),
set up a [cross-country undergraduate capstone project program](http://ucosp.ca/),
helped create a [Master's degree in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/),
and was named ComputerWorld Canada's "IT Educator of the Year" for 2010.
I also met the woman I'm now married to (which probably ought to have gone at the start of this paragraph),
and in 2007 we became the proud and happy parents of
the most wonderful little redhead in the whole wide world.

I left academia in 2010
and spent the next seven years building [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org) into
a worldwide volunteer organization that helps thousands of researchers every year.
I also edited [a book on evidence-based software engineering](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)
and [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*](http://aosabook.org),
in which the creators of fifty open source projects of various sizes describe and critique their systems' designs.
I stepped down from [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) in January 2017.
After a brief stint with [Rangle.io](http://rangle.io) I joined DataCamp,
who I'm proud to say [fired me in 2018](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup).

I am now in the Education group at [RStudio](http://rstudio.com),
where my main responsibility is the [instructor training and certification program](http://education.rstudio.com/trainers).
In my free time I work on books like [*Teaching Tech Together*](http://teachtogether.tech)
and [*JavaScript for Data Science*](http://js4ds.org)
and help build [TidyBlocks](http://tidyblocks.tech) and [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/).
