  <h2>Is Software Engineering?</h2>
</div>

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/engineer-600.jpg" alt="Street Preacher" />
</p>

- "The use of the scientific method to design novel things"
---

template: introduction
- So… no

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Chickens and Eggs</h2>
</div>

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/blind-leading-blind.png" alt="The blind leading the blind" />
</p>

- We know a lot about software and how it's built
- But students aren't taught methods or results
- And we're all too busy to learn them later

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>We Can Do Better</h2>
</div>

- Steady growth over 30 years of empirical studies
- Fueled in part by data from open source projects
- Many studies are small, and not all are well done
- But we can refute some myths and reveal new insights

  <h2>Are Some Languages Better Than Others?</h2>
</div>

Stefik et al 2013: "An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax"

- First studied compared learnability of
  - Perl
  - Quorum: the language their team is building
  - Randomo: syntax "designed" by rolling D&D dice
- Perl is as hard for novices to learn as a language with a randomly-designed syntax

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Are Some Languages Better Than Others?</h2>
</div>
- Second study
  - More subjects
  - Multiple assessment strategies
- Languages in the C family are as hard to learn as a randomly-designed language
- Ruby and Python are significantly easier
- Quorum is easier still

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Nobody Knows Anything</h2>
</div>

Altadmri & Brown 2016: "37 Million Compilations: Investigating Novice Programming Mistakes in Large-Scale Student Data"

- Ask educators for learners' most common mistakes
- Compare their answers to empirical data
- Weak consensus among educators
- Weak correlation with observations
- Educator experience had only weak impact on results

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Nobody Knows Anything</h2>
</div>

Most common actual errors are:

- Mis-matched parentheses (*not* confusing `=` with `==`)
- Invoking methods with the wrong arguments
- Reaching end of non-`void` method without `return`

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Nobody Knows Anything</h2>
</div>

The three that take the most time to fix are:

- Confusing  short-circuit logical and bitwise operators
- Using `==` instead of `.equals` to compare strings
- Ignoring the return value from a non-void method

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Let's Talk About Test-Driven Development</h2>
</div>

Erdogmus et al 2010: "How Effective is Test-Driven Development?"

> [e]vidence from controlled experiments suggests an
> improvement in productivity when TDD is used.
> However…pilot studies provide mixed evidence, some in
> favor of and others against TDD. In the industrial
> studies…evidence suggests that TDD yields worse
> productivity. Even when considering only the more rigorous
> studies…the evidence is equally split for and against a
> positive effect.

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Let's Talk About Test-Driven Development</h2>
</div>

Fucci et al 2016: "An External Replication on the Effects of Test-driven Development Using a Multi-site Blind Analysis Approach"

- Replication study, 39 professionals, real projects
- No significant difference between test-first and test-last development
- "The claimed benefits of TDD may…rather [be] due to the fact that [it] encourages fine-grained steady steps that improve focus and flow."

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Let's Talk About Test-Driven Development</h2>
</div>

> I practice TDD…and it works great. We don't need to prove that it works anymore.

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Code Metrics</h2>
</div>
- Lots of code metrics have been proposed
  - Halstead's measures
  - Cyclometric complexity
  - Many object-oriented measures

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Code Metrics</h2>
</div>
- But nothing works better than counting lines of code
  - El Emam et al 2001: "Confounding Effects of Class Size on the Validity of Object-Oriented Metrics"
  - Herraiz & Hassan 2010: "Beyond Lines of Code: Do We Need More Complexity Metrics?"

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Check Your Error Handling</h2>
</div>

Yuan et al 2014: "Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-Intensive Systems"

- 198 randomly selected, user-reported failures on Cassandra, Hadoop MapReduce, etc.
- Almost all failures require ≤3 nodes to reproduce
- Error logs typically contain sufficient data to reproduce
- *Majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code*

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Open Source</h2>
</div>

Steinmacher et al 2015: "Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects"

- Identify 58 potential barriers
- What matters most?
  1. How easy it is to get set up to make a contribution
  1. How easy it is to find a task to start with
- Other work has also identified "how warmly first contribution was received"

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>There Is No "Geek Gene"</h2>
</div>

Patitsas et al 2016: "Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal"

- The "geek gene" is computing's most enduring and damaging myth
- In fact, only 5.8% of course grade distributions at a large university were actually multi-modal
- But CS faculty are more likely to see distributions as bimodal if they think they're from a CS class
- Even *more* likely if they believe some students are innately predisposed to do well in CS

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Productivity</h2>
</div>

- Prechelt 2000 had programmers implement the same thing in the language of their choice
- How long did it take?

<div align="center">
  <img src="productivity.svg" />
</div>

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Productivity</h2>
</div>

- Shortest and longest times were 0.6 and 63 hours
  - Ratio is 150X (!)
- But people used 7 different languages
- If we only look at Java, times are 3.8 vs. 63 hours (17X)
- But comparing best and worst exaggerates differences
- 90th percentile vs. 50th gives 3.7X

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Productivity</h2>
</div>

Begel & Zimmermann 2014: "Analyze This! 145 Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering"

- Ask a bunch of developers to propose questions, then ask another bunch to rate them
- Developers want to know how people actually use their products
- They *don't* want assessments of individual performance
  - Because they're afraid such measures will be weaponized

---

class: sidebar

## Sidebar

- My colleagues and I did a similar study of CS teachers and CS education researchers
- No overlap between the top 5 questions selected by each group :-(

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>
</div>

- Rapid releases can mean fixes take *longer* to get integrated (Alencar da Costa et al 2017)
- Traditional release cycles prioritize integration of backlog issues
- Rapid release cycles prioritize integration of freshly-fixed issues

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>
</div>

- Teaching people design patterns makes them better programmers (Tichy et al 2000)
- This is *not* obvious
  - Maybe good programmers are just more likely to use patterns
- Three experiments to demonstrate cause and effect

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>
</div>

- Fuzz testing (Miller et al 2021)
- Invented by accident in 1988
- 25-33% of Unix utilities crashed when fuzzed
- Thirty years later, 12-20% still crash

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>
</div>

- Original authors fix their own simple bugs much faster than other people (Zhu & Godfrey 2021)
- But are more likely to fix or change other things at the same time

<div class="flex-row">

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>
</div>

- Major benefit of pair programming is transfer of problem-specific knowledge (Zieris & Prechelt 2000)
- Only 7% of hackathon projects have any activity after 6 months (McIntosh & Hardin 2021)
- Use of code review bots increases the number of merged PRs but decreases inter-programmer communication (Wessel et al 2020)
- Community smells lead to code smells (Palomba et al 2018)

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>When I Rule the World</h2>
</div>

- Software engineering assignments will look like this:

> Given version control repositories for six software
> projects, determine whether long functions are
> more likely to be buggy than short ones.

---
template: rule-the-world
          
- Fits into existing curriculum
- Culturally defensible
- Requires tool use, model building, and statistics
- Encourages students to *do* science
  - So they *understand* it
  - So they *value* it

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
</div>

<div align="center">
  <img src="../img/wikipedian_protester.png" />
</div>

- The world needs more of this
- What are you waiting for?
