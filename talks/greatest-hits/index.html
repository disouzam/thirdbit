  <h2>We Can Do Better</h2>
</div>

- Steady growth of empirical studies over 30 years
- Fueled in part by data from open source projects
- Many studies are small, and not all are well done
- But we can refute some myths and reveal new insights

  <h2>Are Some Languages Better Than Others?</h2>
</div>

<a href="#Stefik2013">Stefik</a>: "An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax"

- Measured how easily novices could read:
  - Perl
  - Quorum: the language their team is building
  - Randomo: syntax "designed" by rolling D&D dice
---

template: stefik-1
- Perl is as hard for novices to learn as a language with a randomly-designed syntax
---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Are Some Languages Better Than Others?</h2>
</div>
- Second study
  - More subjects
  - Multiple assessment strategies
- Languages in the C family are as hard for novices to learn to read as a randomly-designed language
- Ruby and Python are significantly easier
- Quorum is easier still

  <h2>Nobody Knows Anything</h2>
</div>

<a href="#Altadmri2016">Altadmri2016</a>: "37 Million Compilations: Investigating Novice Programming Mistakes in Large-Scale Student Data"

- Ask educators for learners' most common mistakes
- Compare their answers to empirical data
- Weak consensus among educators
- Weak correlation with observations
- Educator experience had only weak impact on results

---

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Nobody Knows Anything</h2>
</div>

Most common actual errors are:

- Mis-matched parentheses (*not* confusing `=` with `==`)
- Invoking methods with the wrong arguments
- Reaching end of non-`void` method without `return`
---

template: altadmri-1

The three that take the most time to fix are:

- Confusing  short-circuit logical and bitwise operators
- Using `==` instead of `.equals` to compare strings
- Ignoring the return value from a non-void method

</div>

<a href="#Nakshatri2016">Nakshatri2016</a>: "Analysis of Exception Handling Patterns in Java Projects: An Empirical Study"

- Most common `catch` block logs the error rather than trying to recover from it
- Next most common does nothing at all (20% of cases)
  - Or converts the checked exception into an unchecked one so it can be ignored.
- Most programmers simply catch `Exception` (78%) or `Throwable` (84%) rather than their subclasses

<a href="#Steinmacher2015">Steinmacher2015</a>: "Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects"

- Identify 58 potential barriers
- What matters most?
  1. How easy it is to get set up to make a contribution
  1. How easy it is to find a task to start with
- Other work has also identified "how warmly first contribution was received"

  <h2>There Is No "Geek Gene"</h2>
</div>

<a href="#Patitsas2016">Patitsas2016</a>: "Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal"

- The "geek gene" is computing's most enduring and damaging myth
- In fact, only 5.8% of course grade distributions at a large university were actually multi-modal
- But CS faculty are more likely to see distributions as bimodal if they think they're from a CS class
- Even *more* likely if they believe some students are innately predisposed to do well in CS

  <h2>Productivity</h2>

<div class="split-title">
  <h2>Productivity</h2>
</div>

- Shortest and longest times were 0.6 and 63 hours
  - Ratio is 150X (!)
- But people used 7 different languages
- If we only look at Java, times are 3.8 vs. 63 hours (17X)
- But comparing best and worst exaggerates differences
- 90th percentile vs. 50th gives 3.7X

<a href="#Begel2014">Begel2014</a>: "Analyze This! 145 Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering"

- Ask a bunch of developers to propose questions, then ask another bunch to rate them
- Developers want to know how people actually use their products
- They *don't* want assessments of individual performance
  - Because they're afraid such measures will be weaponized

  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>

  <h2>A Few Random Results</h2>

- Three experiments to demonstrate cause and effect

-   54.1% of parameters are rarely set by *any* user
-   Only 1.8%-7.8% of parameters are configured by more than 90% of users
-   Up to 48.5% of config issues are about difficulty finding or setting parameters
-   Up to 53.3% of config errors are due to users' staying with default values incorrectly
-   Searching user manuals by keywords is not efficient to help users identify parameters
