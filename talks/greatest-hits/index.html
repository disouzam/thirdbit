		<li>Perl</li>
		<li>Quorum (the language their team is building)</li>

	<section>	  
	  <p>
	    We first present two surveys conducted with students on
	    the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner
	    formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy
	    for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies
	    on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six
	    programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo,
	    and Quorum. To our surprise, we found that languages using
	    a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did
	    not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a
	    language with randomly generated keywords, but that
	    languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did.

	    We used the Blackbox data set to check whether the
	    educators' opinions matched data from over 100,000
	    students and checked whether this agreement was mediated
	    by educators' experience. We found that educators formed
	    only a weak consensus about which mistakes are most
	    frequent, that their rankings bore only a moderate
	    correspondence to the students' data.

	  <p>
	    Method: We analyzed 82 data points collected from 39
	    professionals, each capturing the process used while
	    performing a specific development task. We built
	    regression models to assess the impact of process
	    characteristics on quality and productivity. Quality was
	    measured by functional correctness. Result: Quality and
	    productivity improvements were primarily positively
	    associated with the granularity and uniformity.
	    Sequencing, the order in which test and production code
	    are written, had no important influence. Refactoring
	    effort was negatively associated with both outcomes. We
	    explain the unexpected negative correlation with quality
	    by possible prevalence of mixed refactoring. Conclusion:
	    The claimed benefits of TDD may not be due to its
	    distinctive test-first dynamic, but rather due to the fact
	    that TDD-like processes encourage fine-grained, steady
	    steps that improve focus and flow.

	    We statistically analyzed 778 distributions of final

	    CS professors a series of histograms displaying ambiguous

	    to think about the fact that CS grades are commonly
