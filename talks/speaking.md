title: "Speaker's Rider"
layout: page
---

I am always happy to [give a talk]({{ '/talks/' | relative_url }}),
but after seeing things go wrong and speakers taken advantage of,
I now require hosts to agree to a few things in advance.

*This rider is derived from the one written by [Tatiana Mac][tatiana].
[These guidelines](https://opennews.org/projects/speaker-rider/)
developed by [OpenNews](https://opennews.org/) and [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)
may also be helpful.*

## Inclusivity

### No Support for Hate

- I will not work with,
  or attend events sponsored by,
  any company that has been cited as an inspiration by a mass killer,
  or any company that provides hosting or other services for such companies.
  (You would think this would be an easy bar to get over, but..)
- You don't include speakers who publicly advocate racism, misogyny, or homophobia.
  (Again, you'd think this would be a given...)

### Strictly-enforced Code of Conduct

- Your CoC must explicitly explain what abuse is with clear examples.
- You must have clearly defined methods for dealing with conflicts when they arise
  and trained staff to to handle complaints,
  because CoCs are only as good as their enforcement.

### Representation

- No tracks or panels that are all straight white/Asian males.
- You don't *only* invite marginalized people to speak about their experiences of marginalization.

## Content

### Intellectual Property

- I retain all rights to slides and other material I develop,
  but will make them available for reposting and rehosting under a Creative Commons license.
- I will allow video recordings/live streams so long as they are accessible (captioned)
  and free (no paywalls).
- No censorship of my content (visual, spoken, textual, or otherwise) without my prior express approval.

### Formatting

- No branding of my content (e.g., addition of someone else's logo) without my express prior approval.
- I reserve the right to charge extra if my content is branded.
- I reserve the right to charge for my labor if I am required to reformat my content in any way.
  Any such requirement, and my rate, must be agreed before a contract is signed.

## Costs

### Reporting

- I will provide receipts or invoices for all reimbursable costs.

### Travel expenses

- My full travel costs must be covered unless the talk is in my home town (Toronto, Ontario) or given remotely by video.
- Incidental or unexpected costs (e.g., accommodation during weather delays) must also be covered.

### Lodging expenses

- For the full duration of the conference.
- For engagements requiring more than a four-hour flight, I ask for at least one full day of lodging before the conference.
- You must provide the option to purchase both travel and accommodation on behalf of the speaker.
  While I may choose to pay and then claim,
  the reimbursement model excludes people who cannot front the cost for what is sometimes months.
- Similarly, you must leave your credit card on file for the hotel.

### Speaker honorarium

- For for-profit conferences/events and for-profit companies, I ask for CAD $1500-3000.
- Or $500-1000 if you will donate twice the difference to a mutually-agreed charity,
  which often works out to roughly the same total cost for you thanks to tax write-downs.
- If there are multiple speakers, we must all be paid equally.
  I do not support celebrity speakers getting paid more.
- I may choose to waive my free for not-for-profit/community events where tickets are free or very low priced.

### Ticket to full event

- As [Tatiana says][tatiana], you wouldn't think it would be necessary to spell this out...

## Logistics

### Physically accessibility

- All areas that are part of the conference should be accessible,
  including attendee seating,
  the stage,
  and social event venues
  (where "accessible" means "complies with [2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design][ada] or national equivalent").
- Live captioning (which helps everyone, not just people who are hard of hearing).

### Safety and security

- Security should be provided as needed.
- No transfer or sale of data (in particular, to conference sponsors) without express, prior, case-by-case approval.

### Gender neutral and accessible bathrooms

- Including an option that is both gender neutral *and* accessible.

### Self-identification

- Provide stickers, nametag space, or the equivalent
  so that people can indicate their preferred names, titles, and pronouns.

### Scholarship program

- If you have a scholarship program, don't call it "diversity scholarship":
  that reinforces the notion that "diverse" (which is often falsely interpreted solely as racial diversity) candidates all need charity.
- Call them Scholarships.
  Be explicit to how you choose candidates and don't make them conduct trauma porn to be approved.
- Include travel so that you aren't excluding people who are economically disadvantaged.
  If you can't do this, make it clear that they are solely ticket scholarships.

### Stage setup

- Ensure an accessible stage (see above).
- Require all speakers to use a microphone
  (even—scratch that, *especially*—if they think they have loud voices,
  because otherwise you're requiring audience members to self-identify their needs).
- Speaker's monitor (or an extra laptop so that speakers can see exactly what the audience is seeing).
- Timer visible to the speaker (and enforced time limits for *everyone*).

### Presentation computer

- Speaker option of presenting from conference computer or their own
  (in order to accommodate custom setups, special needs, etc.).
- An opportunity to test the setup far enough in advance of speaking
  to be able to deal with any issues that arise.

## Force Majeure

- If for any reason your event, other speakers, sponsors, attendees, vendors, or messaging become problematic
  (which I reserve the right to determine),
  I reserve the right to withdraw from your event at any time.
- If I withdraw,
  you may no longer associate me with your event in any way
  (for example, you may not use any materials I have prepared or videos of me that you have recorded).
- You are responsible for any costs associated with this,
  not limited to accommodations and travel plan changes.

Please note that I have never had to exercise this clause,
but my experiences with [Shopify][shopify] and [DataCamp][datacamp] have made me realize that
tech will only get better if those in power believe that the rest of us will sometimes take a stand.
