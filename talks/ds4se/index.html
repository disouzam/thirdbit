"You'd like Freedom, Truth, and Justice, wouldn't you, Comrade Sergeant?" said Reg encouragingly.

"I'd like a hard-boiled egg," said Vimes, shaking the match out.

There was some nervous laughter, but Reg looked offended. "In the circumstances, Sergeant, I think we should set our sights a little higher—"

"Well, yes, we could," said Vimes. "But…well, Reg, tomorrow the sun will come up again, and I'm pretty sure that whatever happens we won't have found Freedom, and there won't be a whole lot of Justice, and I'm damn sure we won't have found Truth. But it's just possible that I might get a hard-boiled egg."

- Or build tools, or package managers, or…

- Looked at two dozen books and other people's courses…

- …but none described actual architectures

- [Languages in the C family are as hard to learn as a randomly-designed language](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534973)

- [Students don't make the mistakes instructors think they make](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/46742/1/fp1187-altadmri.pdf)

- [No significant difference between test-driven and test-after development](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~csstmms/FucciEtAl_ESEM2016.pdf)
  - But there *is* a difference between coarse-grained and fine-grained coding

<div class="split-title"><h2>Some Beautiful Truths</h2></div>


- [Most catastrophic failures in distributed data-intensive systems could be prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf)

- [Git is awful because of the mis-match between users' mental models and its actual operation](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2984018)
  - Giving it a human-friendly face is ineffective

- [Computer science grades are not bimodal](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2016/icer_2016_bimodal.pdf)
  - I.e., there is no geek gene

<div class="split-title"><h2>Weak Failures</h2></div>

- To first order, these books have had no impact

- We still don't teach science to CS students
  - Biologists spend 6 hours/week in the lab
  - CS students do one experiment in four years

<div class="split-title"><h2>Weak Failures</h2></div>

<div align="center">
  <img src="../img/carpentries-logo.svg" width="80%">
</div>

- After teaching programming to scientists for 20 years, I've come to believe that science is a good thing

- And that statistics is going to be the math that puts the "engineering" in "software engineering"

- But *the curriculum is full*

- And *we ought to help everyone, not just CS majors*

- Measure this way in the US because everyone else does

- So what tools can we reasonably expect most potential learners to already know?

- Or to pick up in one bladder of hands-on instruction?

<div class="split-title"><h2>A Tool That Just Works …For Some Tasks</h2></div>

- Manipulating data is clumsy…

<div align="center">
  <img src="../img/yahoo-pipes.jpg" width="80%">

---

<div class="split-title"><h2>The Next Step Seemed Obvious</h2></div>

- **Build Scratch blocks for manipulating tabular data**

- [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) provides the framework

- The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) defines the requirements

<div align="center">
  <img src="../img/tidyblocks.png" width="80%">
</div>

---

<div class="split-title"><h2>But It Didn't Work</h2></div>

- [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) is getting creaky

- No natural way to represent join operations with blocks

- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) solves both problems

<div align="center">

- But nobody was (is) willing to fund the work

- Statistics is an authentic task

- *For teachers as well as for students*

---

<div class="split-title"><h2>And Then We Can Teach Engineering</h2></div>

- "The use of the scientific method to analyze and design structures, devices, and systems."

- Require statistics rather than calculus for entry into CS

- Have students analyze software engineering data starting in their first year

---

<div class="split-title"><h2>For Example</h2></div>

> Given source code for six software projects,
> determine whether long functions have more bugs than short ones.
	  
- Requires tool use, model building, and statistical analysis

- Students *do* science, so they *understand and value* it, so they *engage* with it later

- Fits into existing curriculum (implements IFirstYearMath)

- And is *culturally defensible*
