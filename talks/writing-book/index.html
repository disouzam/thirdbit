## Why Should You Listen to Me?

- Author of three technical books (and two for children)
- Co-author of three more
- Editor of six (some of which won awards)
- Have worked with six publishers (and self-published)
- I've made mistakes so you don't have to

---

## Don't Write a Book

- It's a big undertaking, and it's easy to be discouraged
- Instead, start blogging regularly
  - One thousand-word article per week
  - If you can't sustain this, you probably won't finish your book
- Don't (have to) write in book order
  - Blog is to figure out what book order should be

---

## Don't Expect to Make a Profit

- You'll get anything from 12% to 50% royalties from a publisher
  - Higher if you self-publish, but more on that later
- Assume a sale price of $50 and sales of a thousand copies,
  you'll make US$25K
- It'll take (at least) a few hundred hours to write the book
- You'll almost certainly be better off doing some contract coding

---

## So Why Both Writing?

1.  To build your reputation
2.  To give back to the community
3.  Because you enjoy writing

## Self-Publication

- Many venues for self-publishing physically or electronically
  - I use [Lulu](http://lulu.com) for print
- But then you have to do all your own marketing
  - It's really hard to shout loud enough to be heard
- Publishers are as desperate for technical content as you are to be published
- If no reputable publisher wants your book,
  maybe you should think about writing something else

3.  **Start with one or two closely-aligned learner personas.**
    A [learner persona](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas)
    is a short description of who you're trying to teach,
    what they already know,
    and what *they* want to learn.
    Create one or two that are fairly similar and write for them,
    because a book that's meant for everyone is actually useful to no-one.
    And keep in mind the difference between a novice (who is trying to build a mental model),
    a competent practitioner (who has one and wants to fill in gaps in their knowledge),
    and an expert (who wants higher-level discussion of tradeoffs and alternatives):
    no single book can serve all three well.

4.  **Don't write just to cover your ass.**
    I've read or reviewed dozens of books that start with a short introduction to XYZ;
    I cannot remember a single one that was actually useful.
    (If your audience knows Python, they don't need a chapter-length intro to the language.
    If they don't, a one-chapter intro isn't going to help them.)
    I eventually realized that authors included those short introductions
    so that they could claim the book was suitable for novices
    when they knew in their hearts it wasn't.
    Please don't do this.

5.  **Try it out in pieces.**
    I was once part of a team that spent a year and a half building a product
    before showing it to any potential users.
    To no-one's surprise except ours,
    it turned out that most of what we had written was irrelevant to their actual needs.
    Similarly,
    if I had run a workshop or course based on the material for my first book
    *while I was writing it*,
    I would have realized that one of my core assumptions was completely wrong
    while there was still time to correct it.
    Conferences are always looking for tutorials,
    your colleagues will probably welcome some lunch & learn sessions,
    and if all else fails you can create a YouTube channel
    to find out how your material sounds.

6.  **Plan to iterate.**
    There's no point trying material out if you don't incorporate what you've learned,
    and no matter how carefully you plan,
    you'll realize something about the content of Chapter 3 while writing Chapter 4 or 5.
    At a guess,
    every line of *[SDXJS][sdxjs]* has been rewritten at least twice,
    and a quick glance in the version control log tells me that
    some parts have been revisited over a dozen times.

7.  **Drywall, then paint.**
    In other words, get the words and code down,
    *then* worry about diagrams, bibliography citations, glossary entries, and so on.
    The word `FIXME` appeared over a hundred times in first draft of *[T3][t3]*;
    there's no easy way to count,
    but I bet that I changed or discarded more than half of those
    by the time the text settled down.

8.  **Accept that all available authoring tools suck.**
    I've used LaTeX, Microsoft Word, Markdown, and two flavors of computational notebook,
    and they're all more frustrating than they could be.
    I've written and spoken about this many times,
    so I won't belabor the point here,
    but please don't blame yourself.

9.  **Remember Wilkie's Law,**
    which states that an author's job is to produce the manure
    in which an editor grows something worth reading.
    You sweated over that paragraph, but your audience doesn't see your effort, they see your results.
    And yes, the explanation seems clear, concise, and elegant to you,
    but you are not your readers.
    By definition,
    your editor and reviewers are right when they say, "This doesn't make sense."
    Please accept that and revise accordingly.

10. **Don't be afraid to set it aside.**
    I wrote an introduction to R for Python programmers that will probably never see the light of day,
    and have stopped work yet again on an undergraduate guide to being a compassionate programmer.
    In both cases I lost faith in the project:
    the more I wrote,
    the less I believed the book would actually help its intended audience.
    I hope I'll get back to the second book eventually,
    but I won't feel ashamed if I don't:
    scientists don't expect every hypothesis to turn out to be true,
    and authors shouldn't either.

1.  **Read, then write.**
    Go through your two favorite technical books and make notes about
    what their authors have done well.
    Doing this will give you some ideas for your own book,
    but it will also help you become more conscious of your writing---in musical terms,
    help you learn how to listen to yourself while you're playing.
    I learned a lot by reading Brian Kernighan and Jon Udell,
    but your tastes may vary.

2.  **Do the diagrams on a whiteboard first.**
    It's faster and more flexible than any computer drawing tool
    (though I admit I don't have much experience with fingertip sketching apps for tablets).
    The only downside is that you can't save a whiteboard drawing and reload it later,
    but they're so fast to re-create that that's not an issue.

3.  **Don't write a general introduction**
    unless you're going to be one of the first two or three to market.
    Instead,
    focus on a particular aspect ("Python for Web Scraping")
    or a particular audience ("R for Sports").
    Your potential audience may be smaller,
    but you'll reach a much higher percentage of that audience,
    and a focused book is a lot easier to write.

4.  **Don't try to be funny.**
    Very few jokes are funny the second time you hear them;
    even fewer can stand a third re-telling unless they're very, very dry.
    And on a related note,
    please don't use exclamation marks:
    what you're writing probably isn't surprising,
    and certainly won't be the second time around<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.

5.  **Avoid banal advice.**
    Few things are as frustrating to the reader as sentences like,
    "You should carefully consider users' needs,"
    because no sensible person would recommend the opposite.
    If you can't provide a checklist of specific things to consider,
    or a scenario to give the reader insight into how you think through that class of problem,
    you're giving them the intellectual equivalent of junk calories.

6.  **Don't try to compete with the internet.**
    Reference manuals were invaluable to me forty years ago,
    but serve little purpose when the world's knowledge is just a click away.
    You add value by explaining the *how* rather than recapitulating the *what*,
    so do that.

7.  **Check your facts.**
    It doesn't matter how well you know your chosen subject---something
    will have changed since the last time you looked.
    And even if it hasn't,
    it will in the year or more it takes you to write your book.

8.  **Automate, but proofread.**
    This is the technical author's equivalent of "trust, but verify".
    I can re-run all of the examples in my latest book with a single command
    *and* capture their output
    *and* insert that output in the manuscript,
    but I still have to re-read the discussion around those examples
    to make sure it hasn't fallen out of sync.

9.  **Enlist at least two people to do detailed reviews.**
    Lots of people will do cursory reviews
    or give your manuscript a single careful read;
    people who will look at half a dozen sets of changes
    and see what's actually on the page in each
    are worth their weight in rubies.

10. **Stop and ship.**
    Your book will never be perfect.
    It will probably never even feel *finished*,
    any more than software does.
    Ship it anyway.

## Conclusion

- You'll spot a typo within seconds of receiving the first printed copy
- Someone you've never met will say something uncomplimentary in a review online
- Chapter 9 will *never* be as good as you wanted it to be
- To hell with all of that:
  be proud of what you built and of who you helped by building it
