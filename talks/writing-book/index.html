## Why Should You Listen to Me?

- Author of three technical books (and two for children)
- Co-author of three more
- Editor of six (some of which won awards)
- Have worked with six publishers (and self-published)
- I've made mistakes so you don't have to

---

## Don't Write a Book

- It's a big undertaking, and it's easy to be discouraged
- Instead, start blogging regularly
  - One thousand-word article per week
  - If you can't sustain this, you probably won't finish your book
- Don't (have to) write in book order
  - Blog is to figure out what book order should be

---

## Don't Expect to Make a Profit

- You'll get anything from 12% to 50% royalties from a publisher
  - Higher if you self-publish, but more on that later
- Assume a sale price of $50 and sales of a thousand copies,
  you'll make US$25K
- It'll take (at least) a few hundred hours to write the book
- You'll almost certainly be better off doing some contract coding

## So Why Both Writing?

1.  To build your reputation
2.  To give back to the community
3.  Because you enjoy writing

---

## Read, Then Write

- Re-read your two favorite technical books
- Make notes about what their authors did well
  - Ordering, examples, tone, exercises, …
- This will give you some ideas for your own book
- And help you become more conscious of your writing

## Don't Try to Be Funny

- Few jokes are funny the second time
- Fewer can stand a third re-telling
  - Unless they're very, very dry
- And please don't use exclamation marks
  - Your writing won't be surprising the second time around
  - And you should let the reader decide if it's exciting

## Avoid Banal Advice

- "You should carefully consider users' needs"
  - Would anyone recommend the opposite?
- Don't tell me what to think about: tell me what to think
  - Checklists are useful
  - But belong in appendices or online

---

## Create Learner Personas

- A book that's meant for everyone is useful to no-one
- A short description of a specific (fictional) individual:
  - What they already know
  - What they want to learn
- Create at most two

> Aïsha started writing VB macros for Excel in an accounting course and never looked back.
> After spending three years doing front-end JavaScript work
> she now wants to learn how to build back-end applications.
> This material will fill in some gaps in her programming knowledge
> and teach her some common design patterns.

## Three Kinds of Learners

- Novice: trying to build a mental model
- Competent practitioner: wants to fill in gaps in knowledge
- Expert: wants high-level discussion of tradeoffs and alternatives

## Don't Write to Cover Your Ass

- Dozens of books start with a short intro to XYZ
- None of these are useful
  - If your audience knows Python, they don't need a one-chapter intro
  - If they don't, one chapter won't help
- Authors include these so they can pretend their book is accessible to a wider audience
- Please don't do this

---

## Don't Try to Compete With the Web

- Reference manuals were invaluable forty years ago
- But the world's knowledge is now just a click away
- You add value by explaining *how* rather than recapitulating *what*
- And by creating a narrative

---

## Check Your Facts

- It doesn't matter how well you know your chosen subject
- Something will have changed since the last time you looked
- Even if it hasn't,
  it will in the year it takes you to write your book
- Stack Overflow is a *great* resource
  - What questions do people actually have?
  - What answers do they actually find useful?

---

## Don't Write a General Introduction

- Unless you're one of the first three to market
- Focus on a particular aspect: *Python for Web Scraping*
- Or a particular audience: *R for Sports*
- Potential audience is smaller…
- …but you'll reach a much higher fraction…
- …and a focused book is much easier to write

---

## Publishers

- Every publisher has a standard proposal form on their website
  - Who's the audience?
  - Why are you the right person to write this?
  - What's the competition and how will you compete?
- They strongly prefer that you talk to one at a time
- Remember: they need content as much as you need a publisher
- If no reputable publisher wants your book,
  maybe you should think about writing something else

## Self-Publication

- Many venues for self-publishing physically or electronically
  - I use [Lulu](http://lulu.com) for print
- But then you have to do all your own marketing
  - It's really hard to shout loud enough to be heard

---

class: sidebar

## Agents

- Unnecessary for technical books
- Nearly essential for fiction
- Reputable ones are almost always fully booked
- A good reason to go to cons…

---

class: sidebar

## Licensing

- My last few books have been CC-BY-NC
  - You can use it but *not* (re-)sell it without permission
- I maintain the HTML version online
  - Great for errata and incremental improvements
- CRC Press has exclusive rights to print and e-book (including PDF)
- Your mileage will vary

---

## Try It Out

- No lesson survives first contact with learners
- So teach your material while it is in draft
  - At a conference
  - For a local college or bootcamp
  - Online
- If no one signs up, you just learned something useful…

---

## Plan to Iterate

- No point trying material out if you don't act on what *you* learn
- Expect to rewrite some pieces two or three times
- Often as a result of reorganization
- If you can't decide whether X comes before Y or vice versa,
  the odds are that Z has to come before either of them

---

## Drywall, then Paint

- Get the words and code down
- *Then* worry about diagrams, citations, glossary, etc.
- Many of these will disappear during editing
- There's no value in polishing something that readers won't ever see

---

## All Authoring Tools Suck

- Word/Google Docs let you write exactly what you want in the final doc…
  - …but don't play nicely with version control or run automation
- Markdown/LaTeX/computational notebooks work well with version control…
  - …but you have to compile your doc to see your figures in situ…
  - …and you have to debug your bibliography and glossary
- I've built pipelines for every single book I've worked on
- You'll probably have to as well

---

## You Need At Least Two Friends

- Lots of people will do cursory reviews or give your manuscript a single careful read
- You need a couple of people who will read half a dozen sets of changes
- Thank them in the book

---

## Trust Your Editor and Reviewers

- It doesn't matter if it makes sense to *you*
- It only matters if it makes sense to *them*
- So please accept the input of others

> "An author's job is to produce the manure in which an editor grows something worth reading."
>
> — Tom Wilkie

---

## Whiteboard First

- Draw diagrams on a whiteboard
  - Or on paper
- Faster and more flexible than any computer drawing tool
  - Although fingertip apps for tablets are improving quickly
- Take a picture and use as a placeholder until you're sure
- Because you're going to iterate *a lot* on diagram

---

## Automate, but Proofread

- The author's equivalent of "trust, but verify"
- I can re-run all of the examples in my latest book with a single command
  *and* capture their output
  *and* insert that output in the manuscript…
- …but I still have to re-read the discussion around those examples
  to make sure it hasn't fallen out of sync

---

## It's OK to Stop

- I've started more books than I've finished
  - The more I wrote, the less I believed they would help their intended audience
- *This isn't the same as giving up*
- I've also set books aside for a couple of years and then come back to them

---

## Stop and Ship

- Your book will never be perfect
- It will probably never even feel *finished* any more than software does.
- Ship it anyway

---

## Celebrate

- You'll spot a typo within seconds of receiving the first printed copy
- Someone you've never met will say something uncomplimentary in a review online
- Chapter 9 will *never* be as good as you wanted it to be
- To hell with all of that:
  be proud of what you built and of who you helped by building it
