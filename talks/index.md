## [Software Design for Data Scientists]({{ '/talks/sd4ds/' | relative_url }}) {#sd4ds}

Many data scientists are self-taught programmers
and have never been shown how to think about design in the large.
This talk presents ten different approaches,
each of which gives different insights.

## [Software Engineering's Greatest Hits]({{ '/talks/greatest-hits/' | relative_url }}) {#software-engineering-greatest-hits}

Software engineering is in the process of turning itself into an
evidence-based research discipline. This talk describes how that is
happening, why it matters, and a few of the more interesting,
surprising, and controversial results to date.

## [What Everyone in Tech Should Know About Teaching and Learning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1INHfSJzkNpdKonzqYzNlIq6D-H5dyKqs57qoVCAYxB0/) {#what-everyone-in-tech-should-know-about-teaching-and-learning}

Having tried to cram a dozen books about teaching into a two-day course,
I have now tried to cram key ideas from that course into this one-hour talk.

## [Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned]({{ '/talks/lessons-learned/' | relative_url }}) {#carpentry-lessons}

Since its start in 1998, Software Carpentry has evolved from a week-long
training course at the US national laboratories into a worldwide
volunteer effort to improve researchers' computing skills. This talk
explores the lessons we've learned along the way about applying open
source software development techniques to teaching at scale, and about
getting people and institutions to change the way they work.

## [Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Ike Quebec]({{ '/talks/late-night/' | relative_url }}) {#late-night-thoughts}

Keynote at [CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) in Dublin;
[video available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xR50ty5DZ0).

## [Not in the Calendar]({{ '/talks/not-in-the-calendar/' | relative_url }})

Hundreds of books about writing compilers are currently on the market,
but there are only three about writing debuggers. Everyone thinks we
should teach children how to program, but undergraduate courses on
computing education are practically nonexistent. This talk explores what
these gaps and others in undergraduate Computer Science courses tell us
about the state of computing today, and about how we could fix it.
