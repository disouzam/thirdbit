<div class="split-title"><h2>Why Should You Listen to Me?</h2></div>

- I've built a lot of complicated software
- And I've been lucky enough to hang out with some very smart people

<div class="split-title"><h2>Starting Point</h2></div>

<h3 align="center">
  Computer scientists aren't taught software design
</h3>

- The most design-intensive "engineering" discipline there is
- But students don't read, analyze, and critique programs
- We are architects who don't look at existing buildings

<div class="split-title"><h2>A Note on Self-References</h2></div>

*I refer to my own work several times in this talk
because I've spent the last twenty years
trying to turn dozens of books and hundreds of papers
into something that a working programmer (or computer science professor) might actually read.
Please see the bibliographies of the cited works for pointers to the original material,
and please accept my apologies in advance for over-simplifications.*

<div class="split-title"><h2>Twelve Rules</h2></div>

From [[Wilson2022a](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009809)]

<ol>
  <li>Design after the fact</li>
  <li>Design for people's cognitive capacity</li>
  <li>Design in coherent levels</li>
  <li>Design for evolution</li>
  <li>Group related information together</li>
  <li>Use common patterns</li>
  <li>Design for delivery</li>

- "Divide code into coherent pieces" is meaningless until you have seen it done
- "Plan for reasonable future changes" is unhelpful if you haven't seen how code evolves over time
- Top-down instruction (almost) never works because novices don't know what the generalizations are generalizing *from*

<div class="split-title"><h2>The PETE Pedagogical Pattern</h2></div>

From [[Wilson2019a]()]

1. *Problem*: describe what we want to accomplish.
2. *Example*: present a solution to that specific problem.
3. *Theory*: explain the underlying principles and give names to the parts.
4. *Elaboration*: present a second problem/solution pair
   so that learners can see what stays the same and what varies.

- Depends on careful selection of problems and solutions
- And on understanding what the audience is ready for at each stage

<div class="split-title"><h2>Learner Personas</h2></div>

-   Aïsha started writing VB macros for Excel in an accounting course and never looked back.
    After spending three years doing front-end JavaScript work
    she now wants to learn how to build back-end applications.

-   Rupinder is a computer science undergrad.
    He has learned a lot of theory,
    and uses Git and unit testing tools in assignments,
    but doesn't understand how they work.

-   Yim teaches courses on full-stack web development and software design.
    They are happy with the former,
    but frustrated that books about the latter are so abstract
    and use examples that their students can't relate to.

---

<div class="split-title"><h2>Learner Personas</h2></div>

-   This material will fill in some gaps in Aïsha's programming knowledge
    and teach her some common design patterns.

-   This material will give Rupinder a better understanding of those tools
    and of how to design new ones.

-   This material will give Yim starting points for a wide variety of course assignments.

---

<div class="split-title"><h2>Prerequisites</h2></div>

-   Write JavaScript programs using loops, arrays, functions, and classes.

-   Create static web pages using HTML and CSS.

-   Install Node and run programs with it from the command line.

-   Use Git to save and share files.
    (It's OK not to know the 90% of its commands.)

-   Explain what a tree is and process one recursively.
    (This is the most complicated data structure and algorithm we *don't* explain.)
