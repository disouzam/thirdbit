  <h2>The Most Important Thing</h2>
</div>

<div align="center">
  <h3>
    Computer scientists<br/>aren't taught how to design software
  </h3>
</div>

- The most design-intensive "engineering" discipline there is
- But courses where students analyze and critique others' programs are rare
- So no, you haven't missed something obvious

---

<div class="split-title split-first">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for people's cognitive capacity</h2>
</div>

- Short-term memory vs. long-term memory
- You can manage 7±2 things at a time (<a href="#Miller1956">Miller1956</a>)
- So design software to keep *cognitive load* manageable
- Constants are easier to remember than varying values…
  - …unless those values vary in predictable ways
- Keep number of parameters or variables in (mental) scope at any time below this threshold
- Pipes with strict left-to-right reading order are easier to understand than nested function calls

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for people's cognitive capacity</h2>
</div>

- Brains use *chunks* to expand effective size of short-term memory
- So combine things into structures

<hr/>

```
def enclose(x0, y0, z0, x0, y0, z0, nearness):
    …
```

<hr/>

```
def enclose(p0, p1, nearness):
    …
```

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for people's cognitive capacity</h2>
</div>

- Functions should be short, shallow, and single-purpose
  - Of course, no one would argue the opposite…
- If I read a function aloud, are all the steps at the same conceptual level?

```
def main():
    config = buildConfig(sys.argv)
    state = initState(config)
    while (config.currentTime < config.haltTime):
        updateState(config, state)
    report(config, state)
```

- Fancy code metrics don't tell us more about effort required or fault rates than lines of code

<div class="split-title split-first">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…toward widely-used abstractions</h2>
</div>

- Experts have *design patterns* in mind when building code
- Learning them makes you a better programmer (<a href="#Tichy2010">Tichy2010</a>)
- But also makes your code seem more familiar to others
- Examples include:
  - "Most valuable" variable (<a href="#Byckling2005">Byckling2005</a>)
  - Nested `for` loops over 2D array
  - Filter-group-summarize

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…toward widely-used abstractions</h2>
</div>

- A near miss is worse than no pattern at all

```
for (i=0; i<a.width; i++) {
    for (j=0; i<a.height; j++) {
        a[i][j] = cos(abs(a[i][j]) - lemaitre(b_norm, a[j][i]))
    }
}
```

- The eye (literally) doesn't see it
- Maximize "what's unique to this operation / boilerplate"

```
a = cos(abs(a) - lemaitre(b_norm, a.transpose()))
```

<div class="split-title">

- Balance of abstraction and comprehension depends on how much people know

- Some people say that if you need to comment your code you should have written clearer code
- That is *expert blind spot* at work
- Newcomers need help building a *mental model* of the code and problem

---

<div class="split-title split-first">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for evolution</h2>
</div>

- Software changes over time because the problem changes *and* because we learn more
  - The tool shapes the hand
- A good design makes independent evolution of parts easier
  - A fix *here* shouldn't require changes *there*
  - Realistically, should only require a small number of changes in limited, predictable places

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for evolution</h2>
</div>

- Key ideas are *information hiding* and *loose coupling*
- Which manifest as *interface vs. implementation*
  - Many of the more advanced features of programming languages exist to check this
- Examples
  - Deriving classes
  - Polymorphic functions
  - Explicit interfaces or traits

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for evolution</h2>
</div>

- Liskov Substitution Principle (<a href="#Liskov1994">Liskov1994</a>):
  it should always be possible to replace the general thing with a specific thing without breaking
- Design by contract (<a href="#Meyer1994">Meyer1994</a>) extends this idea through time
  - *Pre-conditions* can be weakened (take input the earlier implementation wouldn't)
  - *Post-conditions* can be strengthened (produce a subset of the earlier implementation's output)
  - Can be used to define and verify tests

- <a href="#Schon1984">Schon1984</a> and others have found that
  experts jump between levels looking for concrete refutations of plans as soon as possible
- Depth-first design is therefore a good strategy *if* you write the hard parts first
  - Which most of us avoid

---
      
<div class="split-title split-first">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for testability</h2>
</div>

- We're afraid to modify *legacy code* because things will break unexpectedly (<a href="#Feathers2004">Feathers2004</a>)
- Comprehensive tests make us less afraid
  - But we need testable pieces in order to create tests economically
  - Brings us back to pre-and-post rather than how

---
      
<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for testability</h2>
</div>

- You can tell how you're doing by asking:
  - How easy is it to create a *fixture*?
  - How easy is it to invoke just the behavior we want?
  - How easy is it to check the result?
  - How easy is it to figure out what "right" is?

---
      
<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for testability</h2>
</div>

- *Refactoring* is the process of reorganizing or rewriting code without changing behavior
  - By which we mean "high-level behavior" because of course if you look closely enough...
- <a href="#Fowler2018">Fowler2018</a> describes common refactoring moves for code
- These do to code what tidying steps in a data pipeline do to data (<a href="#Wickham2017">Wickham2017</a>):
  move it toward well-understood forms (<a href="#Kerievsky2004">Kerievsky2004</a>)

  <h2>…as if code was data</h2>
</div>

- The insight on which modern computing is based
- Programs are just text files
  - Style-checking tools
  - Specially-formatted comments as embedded documentation

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…as if code was data</h2>
</div>

- But what's *really* cool is that code in memory is just another data structure
- Functions as arguments
- Functions in data structures
- Dynamic loading
  - Interface vs. implementation
- Lazy evaluation in R
- Decorators in Python

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…as if code was data</h2>

- But see the discussion earlier of comprehension curves
- What is powerful in the hands of experts is spooky action-at-a-distance for novices

<div class="split-title split-first">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for delivery</h2>
</div>

- Development operations (DevOps) has become a buzzword
  - Like "data science" or "computational thinking", the term is popular because people can use it to mean whatever they want
- But the core idea is a good one (<a href="#Kim2016">Kim2016</a>,<a href="#Forsgren2018">Forsgren2018</a>)
  - The code you ship is surrounded and supported by software (and practices) that deliver that code
  - Investment in automation pays off many times over
  - *If* you design things so that they can be automated

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for delivery</h2>
</div>

- Use whatever *build tool* your language expects
  - `pip` or `conda` for Python
  - `devtools` for R
  - Many conflicting options for JavaScript
- Organize code and files the way your build system expects

---

<div class="split-title">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…for delivery</h2>
</div>

- Handle errors
  - Don't just catch and discard (<a href="#Nakshatri2016">Nakshatri2016</a>)
- Integrate logging
  - Reporting that can be dialed up or down is really helpful in production…
  - …particularly if messages from many components are collated…
  - …*if* the messages are helpful
- Design *components*
  - "I'm not ashamed of anything—I just don't want to share anything with you"
  - Services with APIs

  <h2>…after the fact</h2>
</div>

- The most important thing is to *look* as though you designed things (<a href="#Parnas1986">Parnas1986</a>)
- So that the next person can understand it
- Many designers explain architecture by recapitulating history (<a href="#Brown2011">Brown2011</a>,<a href="#Brown2012">Brown2012</a>)
- Challenge and response
  - Can only understand why it does what it does by understanding the problem it was designed to solve

  <h2>…after the fact</h2>
</div>

- Good messages in assertions serve as documentation
  - Not just "pivot index must be greater than 1" but "pivot index must be greater than 1 because the algorithm needs at least two elements below the pivot"
- People never write this
- And that's often the correct decision
  - Predictions about what detail will be needed are usually wrong
  - Keeping that narrative up to date is expensive

<div class="split-title split-first">
  <p>Design…</p>
  <h2>…with villains in mind</h2>
</div>

- Privacy, security, and fairness cannot be sprinkled on after the fact
- *Principle of Least Privilege*: what is the least information this part of the software absolutely needs to do its job?
- Work with partial (obfuscated) personal information
- Work with reduced permissions
  - E.g., PostgreSQL allows select-only access to tables
- Test with database of synthetic information so that you can check for bias

- Diversity improves outcomes in fields from business to healthcare
  (<a href="#Gompers2018">Gompers2018</a>,<a href="#Gomez2019">Gomez2019</a>)
  - Bouncing ideas off each other reveals flaws
- But you should do it because *it's the right thing to do*
