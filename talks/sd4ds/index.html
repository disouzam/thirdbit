## Introduction

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…for people's cognitive capacity</h2>

- Short-term memory vs. long-term memory
- 7±2 (@Miller1956)
- Brains use *chunks* to expand effective size of short-term memory, so create those
- Design software to keep *cognitive load* manageable
  - Number of parameters or variables in (mental) scope at any time
  - Constants are easier to remember than varying values unless those values vary in predictable ways
  - Function length and depth: complex code metrics don't tell us anything more than LoC (@ElEmam2001), but they capture an important idea
- Example
  - Combining things into structures, e.g., Point3d instead of three separate values
  - Pipe with strict left-to-right reading order rather than unpredictable in-and-out
- *Cohesion*: the Single Responsibility Principle for functions and classes

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…toward widely-used abstractions</h2>

- Experts use *patterns*, so learn those
  - It will make you a better programmer (@Tichy2010)
- Example
  - `for` loop over 2D matrix
  - Filter-group-summarize
- Conforming to patterns makes code easier to understand (higher grammar)
  - But only if you match the patterns: example of incorrect double loop being like a typo in a common word (eye doesn't see it)
- And only if people know the patterns
  - Abstraction vs. comprehension depends on how much people know in general and in specific
  - So the best design for a double novice is different from the best designs for the other three quadrants
- Sidebar
  - Some people say that if you need to comment your code you should have written clearer code
  - That is *expert blind spot* at work: newcomers need help building a *mental model* of the code+problem

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…for evolution</h2>

- Software changes over time because the problem changes *and* because we learn more
  - The tool shapes the hand
- A good design makes independent evolution of parts easier
  - Fix a bug or improve performance *here* shouldn't require changes *there*
  - Or at least, should only require a small number of changes in limited, predictable places
- Function and method names should indicate what the code does, not how it achieves that
  - `createConfiguration()` rather than `parseCommandLine()` because you might have a GUI or a configuration file tomorrow
- Sidebar
  - @Schon1984 and others have found that experts jump between levels looking for concrete refutations of plans as soon as possible
  - Depth-first design is therefore a good strategy *if* you write the hard parts first, which most of us avoid
- Key ideas are *information hiding* and *loose coupling*, which manifest as *interface vs. implementation*
  - Many of the more advanced features of programming languages exist to check this
  - Example: deriving classes, polymorphic functions, explicit interfaces or traits
- Liskov Substitution Principle (@Liskov1994): it should always be possible to replace the general thing with a specific thing without breaking
- Design by contract (@Meyer1994) extends this idea through time
  - *Pre-conditions* can be weakened (take input the earlier implementation wouldn't)
  - *Post-conditions* can be strengthened (produce a subset of the earlier implementation's output)
  - Can be used to define and verify tests

---
      
<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…for testability</h2>

- Legacy code is code we're afraid to modify because things will break unexpectedly (@Feathers2004)
  - Comprehensive tests make us less afraid
  - But we need testable pieces in order to create tests economically
  - Brings us back to pre-and-post rather than how
- You can tell how you're doing by asking:
  - How easy is it to create a *fixture*?
  - How easy is it to invoke just the behavior we want?
  - How easy is it to check the result (and do you know what "right" is)?
- *Refactoring* is the process of reorganizing or rewriting code without changing behavior
  - By which we mean "high-level behavior" because of course if you look closely enough...
- @Fowler2018 describes common refactoring moves for code
  - These do to code what tidying steps in a data pipeline do to data (@Wickham2017): move it toward well-understood forms (@Kerievsky2004)

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…as if code was data</h2>

- The great insight on which all of modern computing is based
  - A program is a bunch of text files that can be searched and processed like any other
  - Code in memory is a data structure that can be processed like any other
- Example
  - Style-checking tools
  - Embedded documentation tools (explain the difference between doc comments and docstrings)
  - Dynamic loading (interface vs. implementation)
  - Lazy evaluation in R
  - Decorators in Python
- But see the discussion earlier of comprehension curves
  - What is powerful in the hands of experts is incomprehensible action-at-a-distance in the eyes of novices

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…for delivery</h2>

- Development operations (DevOps) has become a buzzword
  - Like "data science" or "computational thinking", the term is popular because people can use it to mean whatever they want
- But the core idea is a good one (@Kim2016,@Forsgren2018)
  - The code you ship is surrounded and supported by software and practices that deliver that code
  - Putting effort into the support pays off many times over
- Example
  - Use whatever *build tool* your language expects (`pip` or `conda` for Python, `devtools` for R - many conflicting options for JavaScript)
  - Organize files the way your build system expects
  - Use *semantic versioning* to identify releases (*not* the names of your cats in the order in which they adopted you)
  - Publish your software wherever your ecosystem expects it
- Handle errors
  - Don't just catch and discard (@Nakshatri2016)
- Integrate logging
  - A log that can be dialed up or down is really helpful in production *if* the messages are helpful
  - Another pattern to learn and use

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…graphically</h2>

- Flowcharts are unfairly maligned (@Scanlan1989)
- Very few programmers use UML the way it was intended (@Petre2013)
- But almost all draw pictures to help them design (@Cherubini2007)
- Tension between brainstorming and blueprints
  - The term "software engineering" was aspirational and misguided
  - Code *is* the design: the manufacturing step is cheap and can be automated
- Examples
  - Entity-relationship diagrams: widely used because they are actually helpful
  - Class diagrams: not widely used outside textbooks because they're not
  - Swim lane diagrams showing message exchanges: useful in their niche
  - Block-and-arrow architecture diagrams: probably the most widely used (probably because of their informality)
  - (My favorite) use case maps: message exchanges overlaid on architecture diagrams

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…after the fact</h2>

- @Parnas1986: the most important thing is to *look* as though you designed things
  - So that the next person (who might be you a year from now) can understand it
- Many designers explain architecture by recapitulating history (@Brown2011,@Brown2012)
  - Challenge and response
  - Can only understand why it does what it does by understanding the problem it was designed to solve
- Good messages in assertions serve as documentation
  - Not just "pivot index must be greater than 1" but "pivot index must be greater than 1 because the algorithm needs at least two elements below the pivot"
- People don't write this
  - And are often right not to: speculating about what detail will be needed (and almost always getting it wrong)
  - Keeping that narrative up to date is expensive

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…with villains in mind</h2>

- Privacy, security, and fairness cannot be sprinkled on after the fact
- *Principle of Least Privilege*: what is the least information this part of the software absolutely needs to do its job?
- Examples
  - Work with partial (obfuscated) personal information
  - Design to work with reduced permissions (e.g., PostgreSQL allows select-only access to tables)
  - Test with database of synthetic information so that you can check for bias

---

<p class="split-title">Design…</p>
<h2 class="split-title">…collaboratively and inclusively</h2>

- Diversity improves outcomes in fields from business to healthcare (@Gompers2018,@Gomez2019)
  - Bouncing ideas off each other reveals flaws
  - A vocal minority in tech have subverted this finding by claiming that "diversity of thought" can serve instead of diversity of race, gender, or wealth
- An open license and a code of conduct tells people they are invited to take part in the conversation
  - Licensing *is* a design issue, since you cannot use components whose licenses are incompatible with yours
- Similarly, designing so that software is easy to extend and bugs usually only require changes in one place makes it possible for newcomers to contribute (@Sholler2019)
