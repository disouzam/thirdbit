title: "Not on the Shelves"

<p><em>From the introduction to the first version:</em></p>

<p>I was watching <em>Field of Dreams</em> again a couple of nights
ago. When the ghostly voice whispered, "If you build it, they will
come," I thought, "That's it! If I write reviews of the books I'd most
like to read, maybe someone will write the books!"</p>

<p>The next morning, as I was nursing my hangover, I explained my plan
to a friend. Her first response was, "Yeah, maybe," but when I
persisted, she took the icepack off her forehead long enough to
explain the idea of sympathetic magic to me. According to her, there's
a tribe whose land is occasionally stricken with drought. When the
rain fails to arrive, the tribal elders get out a plow and a handful
of seeds and go and till the soil anyway. The idea is that by doing
what they would have done if the rain had fallen, they can force it to
actually fall. That, she said, is sympathetic magic; by writing
reviews of books that don't exist, you're trying to trick the universe
into bringing the books into existence.</p>

<p>When she put it that way, it sounded kind of silly, but after
reviewing more than fifty computer-related books in the last eight
years, I'd be happy to sacrifice a rooster to get someone to write
something <em>different</em>. I'm constantly amazed by how few
different books there actually are: my local bookstore, for example,
has eight shelves of Java books, but if you were to do a set-union on
their contents, you'd be left with only two or three books' worth of
information. What's worse, a lot of things I really want to know
wouldn't be there at all. It's almost as if our notion of what we
should put into a book on a new programming language, or on user
interfaces, or software engineering, somehow got stuck in the early
1980s.</p>

<p>These reviews of non-existent books are my attempt to point out the
gaps in the computing literature, and, indirectly, the gaps in most
programmers' education (including my own). If, by chance, one of these
books already exists, please drop me a line; otherwise, if you'd like
to try writing one of them, please drop me a line as well, so that I
can review it for real when it comes out.<P></p>
