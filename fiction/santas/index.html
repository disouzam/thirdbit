<p><em>You probably think this is a Christmas story because of the santas, but it’s not. It’s about right and wrong and revolution, about true love and not-so-true love, and about how by the time you go home, it isn’t really home any more.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s one kiss and quite a few explosions. The footnotes are there to lighten things up; if you need a someone to hold your hand during the scary bits, tough luck—I’m just a book, and we don’t have hands.</em></p>

<h2 id="episode-1-in-which-we-meet-our-protagonist">Episode 1: In Which We Meet Our Protagonist</h2>
<p>Once up on a time, in a world halfway between yours and mine, lived a young santa named Finner. They came from a long line of santas and elves: their mother made her first wind-up singing wombat when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself, while their father had started helping with deliveries as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<sup> There’s a story behind the word “reliably” in that sentence, but it’s best told some other time. </sup></p>
<p>Now, Finner enjoyed elfing: the smell of solder, the <em>shick shick</em> of freshly-sharpened scissors, and the pride they felt when the two halves of a dovetail joint fit perfectly together. But sitting in a workshop made them restless. Their mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over to burn off the energy: it only made them sweaty. They tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with their eyes closed while they hummed softly to themselves like the monks of Lotse Nuffin:<sup> The monks were their father’s favorite clients. They wanted nothing, so every year that’s exactly what he took them, and they were always grateful. </sup> all they got was a cold bum.</p>
<p>They tried helping with deliveries too, and they enjoyed it just as much. After all, who <em>wouldn’t</em> enjoy slithering down sooty chimneys scaling the icy concrete sides of apartment buildings, or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof? “Me,” said the small voice in Finner’s head. “Or rather, I do, but it’s not enough.”</p>
<p>They tried to talk to their friends about it without actually explaining the problem. That… didn’t go well. Finner’s parents were the only elf and santa in town. There were others nearby—aunts and uncles and second cousins twice removed and even a few who’d married into the trade and done quite well for themselves despite what Finner’s great-grandmother never actually said out loud at family gatherings<sup> She was a hundred and twenty two years old, and could not say things so loudly that no one else could hear themselves think.</sup>—but none of children Finner went to school with or played Hide and Stay Hidden with could ever really understand how much hard work went into making that one day special every year.</p>
<p>That thought made them wonder if they were lazy, which was a synonym for “sinful” where they lived, so they tried a few experiments. Working twice as hard made them even sweatier than running up and down stairs. Working half as hard made their father ask if they were sick and their mother mutter about teenagers. Neither made the yearning in their chest go away. It grew and grew until finally, desperately, they realized there was only one thing left for them to do. They would have to ask their great-grandmother for advice.<sup>Yes, <em>that</em> great-grandmother.</sup></p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly spent most of her time napping or having long philosophical conversations with her peg-legged cat and her one-eyed parrot, but there were stories about her. She had been a santa—one of the greats. She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine <em>without using a submarine herself</em>, and then delivered a baby on the way home.<sup> “Delivered” in the conventional sense of helping someone give birth rather than the postal sense used for packages. Unlike the ones in your world, the santas and elves in Finner’s didn’t make cunning replicas of human infants and swap them for the real ones in the dead of night while their parents were sleeping. </sup> Everyone was a little bit afraid of her, except for the unfortunate few who had felt the full force of her disapproving glare: they were a <em>lot</em> afraid. But if you had a problem—a <em>real</em> problem, not just a lost sock or a broken heart<sup>Gran-Granna Tumbly did once make an exception for someone whose heart was broken because they had lost a very special sock and there was a very real chance of the world ending as a result, but that story is also best told some other time.</sup>—you could always knock on her door.</p>
<p>Finner waited until Tuesday afternoon before going to see her. The postman delivered<sup>In the postal sense of the word.</sup> her weekly order of chocolate on Tuesday just before lunch, and Finner hoped that would put her in a good mood. “Or at least a less grumpy one,” they thought as they trudged through the damp, clumpy snow that had fallen overnight. The last time they had seen her had been the family gathering at Long Night the year before. Finner’s uncle had accidentally served Gran-Granna a cup of camomile tea, and had squirmed for an hour as she drank it one slow, withering sip at a time.</p>
<p>The Tumbly house looked exactly like those on either side of it: a front door with an evergreen wreath on it, a large curtained window to one side, and a pair of smaller windows with matching curtains on the floor above. The downstairs window had a warm, welcoming glow, and even from the street Finner could smell curry and freshly-baked bread. The only remarkable thing was a statue of a cat sitting on an oddly-shaped plinth in the middle of the front yard, its stone eyes fixed on a snow-filled bird bath.<sup>The houses on either side had a miniature Ferris wheel and a model locomotive in their front yards, though, so to be fair, the statue wasn’t <em>that</em> remarkable.</sup></p>
<p>Finner took a deep breath, walked up to the door, and knocked. When nothing happened they knocked again. “Well that was a bust,” they said aloud, secretly relieved.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily,” rumbled a voice behind them. “She just nipped out to get some broccoli. If you don’t mind waiting a moment…?”</p>
<p>Finner turned around slowly. The stone cat had turned its head toward them, but was clearly still keeping one eye on the empty bird bath. “I—sure,” they said lamely, then added, “Thank you,” because a stone statue of a cat is still in some sense a cat, and one of the first lessons a santa is taught is to always be polite to cats.<sup>And subway conductors, but that’s also—you know what? There are going to be so many of those that from now on, if it really is a story for another time, we’ll just not mention it.</sup></p>
<p>“Of course,” the cat rumbled. It turned its head back toward the bird bath, and together they waited in silence.</p>
<p>They didn’t have to wait long. A tricycle taxi rolled up in front of the house and came to a gentle stop. The taxi pedaller climbed out of his seat, stretched until his spine went <em>pop!</em>, nodded at Finner (or possibly the cat), and then opened cab door and helped Gran-Granna Tumbly down. Pocketing the half-coins she handed him, he climbed back onto his seat and pedalled away.</p>
<p>Finner belatedly remembered that they were an able-bodied youth and Gran-Granna was neither. “Can I carry that for you?” they asked, hurrying back down the short walk to the gate.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at the broccoli in her hand and snorted. “I think I can manage, thank you,” she said. “Did you catch anything?”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Finner started, confused.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” the cat statue rumbled. “But I remain hopeful.”</p>
<p>“Hmph.” Finner stepped out of the way as Gran-Granna Tumbly walked briskly up the path, the tip of her cane stabbing through the snow on every second step. “Well, since you’re here, you might as well come in.”</p>
<p>“Yes’m,” Finner said obediently. With one last glance at the motionless cat they followed her through the door and into the rest of their life.</p>

<h2 id="episode-2-in-which-a-door-opens">Episode 2: In Which a Door Opens</h2>
<p>Finner had never actually been in Gran-Granna’s house before, but they had heard stories. A richly-patterned carpet in the hall that looked like it might once have been able to fly: check. A set of coathooks with gargoyle faces: check. A sitting room filled with a riot of carefully-tended greenery and a mis-matched pair of overstuffed chairs: check. Crossed harpoons over the fireplace and dozens of framed pictures of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, neighbors, friends, enemies<sup>Some of which had dates and locations written on them in neat, smug lettering.</sup>, and the grateful, if somewhat perplexed, crew of a submarine: check.</p>
<p>And there was a teapot—<em>the</em> teapot, the one people spoke about in hushed voices. It didn’t look special, but it was never empty and its contents were never cold. Bitter, sometimes, if that’s what Gran-Granna thought her guest needed most, but never cold.</p>
<p>Finner waited for Gran-Granna to settle into a chair before seating themself nervously on the edge of the other one. She spooned a bit of sugar into a green-and-white teacup, glanced at them, added a bit more, and then poured slowly and carefully. “You’ll want to let that cool down a bit,” she advised, filling the second cup for herself and sitting back with it cradled in her hands.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Finner said, not knowing what else to say. What <em>were</em> they going to say? “Nothing feels right,” was awfully vague, and, “What should I do with my life?” seemed awfully—</p>
<p>“The thing about being old,” Gran-Granna said without any preamble, “Is that people think it makes you wise.”</p>
<p>The silence that followed was broken only by the ticking of the burl clock in the kitchen. “Doesn’t it?” Finner asked, because it felt like the kind of statement that wanted to be invited to take off its coat and sit for a while.</p>
<p>“Not so far as I can tell,” Gran-Granna sighed. She sipped her tea, eyes closing with pleasure like a cat having its ears scratched. “But it does give you a passel of stories to tell. Take your Auncle Minglin, for example.” She gestured at a picture on the wall of someone Finner vaguely remembered having spilled cranberry juice all over a tablecloth at some point. “Kind heart, and a beautiful singing voice, but as clumsy as an ox on ice skates. Broke or burned every toy they tried to make, so no elfing for them, and they could trip over a rock that was clear across the other side of the street.”</p>
<p>“So no deliveries?” Finner ventured.</p>
<p>“That’s certainly the conclusion they reached. And they were pretty down in the mouth about it, let me tell you. The world needs doctors and zeppelin pilots and what-not, but when when you’ve been told your whole life that you’re destined for something else, well, that’s hard.”</p>
<p>Finner turned their teacup around in their hands. “So what happened to them?”</p>
<p>Gran-Granna smiled smugly. “They ran off and joined the opera. Last I heard, they were singing six shows a week with not an empty seat in the house.” She sipped her tea. “They way I look at it, they <em>did</em> become a santa—one of the year-round kind. They’re giving people music night after night, and that’s a wonderful gift.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “But they don’t see it that way, and I don’t know if they ever will. Doesn’t matter how hard people applaud or how many times they’re called back for encores—deep in their heart, they’ll always think of themselves as ‘not at santa’.”</p>
<p>“Which brings us to you,” she continued, bright eyes fixed on Finner, who at that moment desperately regretted having come to see her and wished they could be almost anywhere else in the world.<sup>“Almost”, because they had taken geography in school and knew about volcanoes.</sup></p>
<p>“M-me?” Finner stammered.</p>
<p>“Yes, y-you,” Gran-Granna said impatiently. “Your folks have been worried about you for a while now. Oh, I know, you didn’t think anyone had noticed, but you’ve been mopey and anxious and all the other things young people indulge themselves in these days, only more so.”</p>
<p>A clock chimed quietly in the kitchen next door. Somewhere in the distance, someone called for their children to come inside, it was time for bed and their teeth weren’t going to brush themselves. “I just don’t know what to do,” Finner confessed, angry at the tears that they were absolutely <em>not</em> going to cry. “I like making toys and spatulas and, and socks and everything, I really do, but—I dunno. And deliveries are—everyone else seems excited and it’s like I’m just watching myself do it, you know? Like this is someone else’s life and I’ve just put it on like a sweater except it doesn’t quite fit and no matter how many times I wash it, it’ll still smell a bit like whoever it really belongs to.”</p>
<p>“Hmph,” Gran-Granna Tumbly snorted. “Fancy words like that, maybe you ought to think about becoming a writer.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Finner mumbled.<sup>They’d had to write stories and poems in school. On the whole they preferred geography, especially coloring in maps of Canada.</sup></p>
<p><em>THUMP!</em> They jumped as something heavy hit the floor in the room overhead. “What was that?”</p>
<p>Gran-Granna reached for her cane and struggled to her feet. “Never you mind,” she said curtly. “It’s late and your folks will be wondering where you are. You best be—”</p>
<p><em>THUMP!</em> “Ow, get off me!” a female voice said peevishly.</p>
<p>Finner reached for their great-grandmother. “I think someone’s up there,” they whispered loudly.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna rolled her eyes. “Door,” she said, pointing at it with her cane. “You. Through it. Now.”</p>
<p>“Vidancia! Vidancia, where are you?” a second voice bellowed from above.</p>
<p>“Quiet!” the first voice said.</p>
<p>“Vidanci-ulp!” Finner practically heard someone putting their hand over someone else’s mouth.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna glared at them. They gulped and gestured weakly toward the front door. “You’re right, I should—” they started.</p>
<p>A door opened upstairs. Heavy boots thumped on the carpeted floor. The biggest, beardiest santa Finner had ever seen came downstairs and wrapped his arms around Gran-Granna Tumbly in a number two hug.<sup>Both arms, full wrap, strong squeeze that’s held for at least three full heartbeats.</sup> To Finner’s complete surprise the santa starting crying.</p>
<p>“Oh Vidancia,” he blubbered. “It’s awful. It’s really, really awful this time.”</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly wriggled out of the beard and the hug. “Let me guess—did your llamas eat your favorite hat again?”</p>
<p>“The llamas are gone,” said the second santa who had come silently down the stairs behind the first. She was no taller than Finner, but lean where the first santa was brawny, and her uniform—Finner did a double take. Her hood and sack were red and white, but the rest seemed to be changing color to match the carpet on the stairs. And—was that an ax strapped to the first santa’s back? A really big ax that looked like it was designed for chopping the heads off trolls rather than turning logs into kindling?</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘gone’?” Gran-Granna demanded, pulling a handkerchief out of her sleeve and handing it to the big santa in a way that clearly meant, “Stop sniffling and get ahold of yourself.”</p>
<p>“He means they’re <em>gone</em>,” the second santa said acidly, wincing as she sat on the stairs. “No longer in their proper surroundings. Ex-located. Completely, utterly, elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“You’re hurt,” Gran-Granna said accusingly, hurrying forward.</p>
<p>The second santa waved her off. “It’s nothing. Just some broken ribs. And maybe an eardrum. One of my presents went off a little early,” she added, sounding just a little bit proud.</p>
<p>“It was the Suits,” the burly santa said, wiping his eyes on a sleeve that Finner could have used as a sleeping bag. “The elves were helpin’ me load up the stagecoach for the weekly delivery, just like they always do, an’ then blam!” He smacked a meaty fist into an equally meaty palm. “There they were, all over us. I tried to fight ’em off, Vidancia, I swear.” His lower lip trembled.</p>
<p>“I know you did,” Gran-Granna said gently. “What about your elves?”</p>
<p>“Out through the chimney, somewhere safe.” The second santa shifted uncomfortably, waving Gran-Granna away a second time. “At least, as safe as anyone right now.”</p>
<p>She turned her gaze on Finner. Something very much like a mild electric shock ran down their spine as the santa’s dark eyes locked with theirs. “And who’s this?” she asked.</p>
<p>Before anyone could answer there was another pair of <em>thumps</em> upstairs. “Well,” said a jovial voice a moment later. “It’s not exactly a palace, is it?”</p>
<p>The burly santa growled and reached for his ax. The one on the stairs struggled to her feet. “They’re here,” she spat.</p>
<p>“Hmph.” Gran-Granna Tumbly twisted the head of her cane and to Finner’s absolute dumbfoundment<sup>Yes, that really is a word.</sup> drew a slender silver rapier. “Hold this,” she ordered, handing the remaining cane-y bit of the cane to Finner, and then everything went a little bit sideways.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="episode-3-in-which-a-moderate-amount-of-mayhem-occurs">Episode 3: In Which a Moderate Amount of Mayhem Occurs</h2>
<p>The second santa pulled a grenade out of her sack, drew the pin with her teeth, and chucked it overhand up the stairs. “Bang,” she said calmly, and sure enough, a second later there was a loud, sharp <em>crack!</em> Bilious green foam began expanding into the stairs.</p>
<p>“That won’t hold them for long,” Gran-Granna Tumbly said, twisting at the waist to limber up. Her spine made a cracking noise that put the grenade’s to shame.</p>
<p>“We can take ’em!” the big santa bellowed, hefting his totally intimidating ax, which was not in fact larger than Finner.</p>
<p>“No we can’t,” Gran-Granna snapped. A UPF<sup>Unidentified Piece of Furniture. It’s like a flying saucer, except it’s usually rectangular (unless it’s a coffee table), doesn’t fly (unless it’s thrown very hard), and isn’t of alien origin. Usually.</sup> crashed through a window upstairs and landed in the front yard with a wet <em>thud</em>.</p>
<p>“Awesome!” a voice exclaimed above them. There was the slap of high-fives being exchanged, then boots on the porch roof and another pair of wet thuds as two of their attackers jumped down onto the snow-covered ground.</p>
<p>Sparkles ran down the rapier in Gran-Granna’s hand. “Is that a <em>magic</em> sword?” Finner breathed.</p>
<p>“Not magic enough,” their great-grandmother muttered. “You two! Chimmey, now! And you.” She pointed at Finner. “You go with them and you do exactly what they say, understand?”</p>
<p>“Go where?” Finner didn’t have a chance to ask, because at precisely that moment something roared in the front yard. It was the kind of sound that bypasses the ears’ request to form an orderly line and goes directly to the bit in the back of the brain that evolved to keep a million generations of ancestors out of large predators’ stomachs.</p>
<p>“What the—” someone in the front yard started to say but never managed to finish. The other newcomer simply screamed, briefly. There was a moment of stunned silence, and then the shooting started.</p>
<p>The burly santa yanked Finner under the shelter of his enormous ax. Bullets ricocheted off it, punching little round holes in the pictures hanging on the walls. The other santa dove across the room to take shelter beside Finner. Punctured in a dozen places, the green foam in the stairs made a wet, farty noise and began to deflate.</p>
<p>“Get to the chimney!” Gran-Granna Tumbly shouted. Her sword flashed back and forth, knocking bullets away from them.<sup>Or possibly from her teapot. Finner wondered about that later, but never found the courage to ask.</sup> “<em>Now!</em>”</p>
<p>The front door burst open. The stone cat charged through the room and into the foam still left on the stairs. It was bigger than it had been before—much bigger—but Finner didn’t have time to think about that because the big santa picked them up like a sack of laundry and took two enormous strides across the room and something something something, Finner didn’t see exactly what, but suddenly Gran-Granna’s fireplace was gone, or rather it was still there but it was also a doorway, like one of those puzzle pictures that looks like two different things at once and then everything stretched around them or possibly they did the stretching and they were somewhere else.</p>
<p>It was bright. In fact, it was daytime, when a moment ago it had been dark and evening. And there was sand—lots of sand. And—</p>
<p>“That looks like a pyramid,” a small part of Finner’s brain<sup>Not the evolved-to-stay-out-of-predators part—pyramids weren’t really its concern.</sup> told the rest of them.</p>
<p>The second santa got to her feet and brushed sand off her uniform, which had already started to turn a sandy-beige color. She pressed one hand against her ribs and took the kind of breath you take when you’re trying not to whimper. “Where are we?” she asked.</p>
<p>It took Finner a moment to realize she was asking them. “I—I don’t know.” It was hot—much too hot for the coat they had on. And where was Gran-Granna?</p>
<p>The little santa stared at them. Her eyes widened. “They don’t know,” she said to the big santa.</p>
<p>“Don’t know what?” Finner was about to ask, but before they could, a voice behind them moaned, “Greeeeeeetings…”</p>
<p>They spun around and found themselves face-to-face with—they weren’t quite sure what. It was tall and withered and wrapped in tattered bandages made from the rags of what might once have been a santa’s uniform. Its eyes didn’t quite line up, and—was that a <em>bone</em> of the end of one of its arms where there really ought to be a hand?<sup>Even a mechanical hand. Finner knew a santa who had started wearing one after an unfortunate encounter with an overly protective guard goose, and more than a few careless elves had needed parts replaced after what people referred to as “workshop incidents”.</sup></p>
<p>The burly santa hefted his ax. “Friend or foe?” he demanded.</p>
<p>The santa smiled, or more accurately bared its large, yellow teeth. “That depends on… whether you brought… tea. And treats… for my pets.” At the word “treats”, one of the giant cat statues at the base of the pyramid turned its head and blinked, which made the “stay out of predators” part of Finner’s brain go, “Ding ding ding!”</p>
<p>“Tea?” the burly santa asked, clearly never having had this particular response to his friend-or-foe question before.</p>
<p>“She always… brings tea. And treats. And sometimes… a magazine.”</p>
<p>“No magazines, I’m afraid, and no tea either,” the small santa said. “We had to leave Sensei Tumbly’s in rather a hurry.”</p>
<p>“Ssss…” The mummy santa hissed with disappointment. “I suppose… you’re going… to claim… refuge?”</p>
<p>The lean santa shot her burly companion a look to stop him from speaking. “As is our right,” she said. “A cookie, a glass of milk, and the use of your chimney.”</p>
<p>“Heh. Heh. Heh.” The mummy said the words one by one. “No milk… or cookies… here. Not for… a long… time.”</p>
<p>The giant stone cat behind it stepped down from its pedestal. Finner gulped as three more joined it. Some seemed to be missing minor parts like ears or tails, but that didn’t do anything to quiet the “ding ding ding!” in Finner’s brain.</p>
<p>The lean santa reached into her sack. For a heartbeat Finner thought she was going to throw another foam grenade, but instead she pulled out a man’s tie. Blue with silver pinstripes that sparkled in the light, it flapped in her hand when she held it up as if caught in a stiff breeze. Which, Finner noted dumbly, there definitely wasn’t.</p>
<p>The cats growled. “You bring… <em>that</em>… here!?” the mummy hissed.</p>
<p>The tie wriggled and tried to escape as the santa stuffed it back in her sack. “Not by choice. They came out of nowhere. We had people watching the chimney night and day, and I swear, they didn’t come through that way.” She glanced at the santa with the ax. “They took his llamas. And smashed his carriage. And—”</p>
<p>The burly santa put a gentle hand on her shoulder. “And the elves got away,” he said. “They’re safe. We can rebuild again.”</p>
<p>The smaller santa shrugged out from under his hand. “Safe for now, maybe. I’m just so tired of running.” She was exhausted, Finner realized, exhausted and frightened but trying hard not to show it.</p>
<p>The mummy hissed sympathetically. “I know… how… you feel… child.” It looked past her at the dry sand surrounding them. “This was… green… once. Long ago… Before <em>they</em> came…”</p>
<p>One of the stone cats yowled softly. The mummy straightened. “Yes… I will… grant you… refuge. Follow… me.”</p>
<p>It turned toward the pyramid, then hesitated. “And… please… don’t mind… the mess. I’m… redecorating.”</p>
<p>As they climbed the worn stone steps on the pyramid Finner sidled over to the smaller santa. “Can you please tell me what’s going on?”</p>
<p>She sighed. “The usual, I’m afraid. We’re trying to save the worlds.”</p>

<h2 id="episode-4-in-which-some-introductions-are-made-and-some-explanations-finally-given">Episode 4: In Which Some Introductions are Made and Some Explanations Finally Given</h2>
<p>Zombies and mummies are similar in many ways—the shambling gait, the moaning, and of course the whole “undead” thing—but there are important differences as well. First, mummies are generally royalty, or the servants of royalty, while zombies tend to have been idiots who went into the basement after dark despite the strange sounds they heard or didn’t run fast enough when someone shouted, “Look out, they’re coming!”</p>
<p>Second, mummies are created through a complex multi-step process during which the internal organs and the brain are removed, packed in salt, and stored in canopic jars. “Which is… just a… fancy word… for jars… that hold… someone’s… squishy bits,” the mummy explained as they climbed the stairs to an entrance in the side of the pyramid that would have seemed quite large if set into anything smaller than an artificial mountain made of enormous blocks of sandstone.<sup>Some of which contained really interesting fossils, including a trilobite holding a fully-functional ray gun. Unfortunately, that one was right in the middle of one of the blocks, so it doesn’t play a part in this story. It does make you wonder, though, what might lie behind the doors you walk past every day.</sup></p>
<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, zombies devoured the brains of the living. “Or sometimes… their livers…” the mummy wheezed. “It’s a… cultural… thing.” Mummies, on the other hand, were strictly vegan: <em>very</em> strictly, since they didn’t eat at all. “Though… we do… like a… nice cup… of tea,” the mummy added wistfully.</p>
<p>Two stone cats sat on their haunches at the top of the steps. One blinked slowly as they entered the pyramid, but other than that they didn’t acknowledge the motley foursome.</p>
<p>Inside was a corridor with sloping sides, wide enough for the four of them to walk side by side. Torches guttered in sconces every few dozen strides, their light making the figures painted on the walls dance.<sup>It didn’t occur to Finner until much later to wonder about the torches. Were they some sort of magical everlasting torch? Or were they delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays like the cheese their father was so fond of? And why torches rather than lamps? The mummy’s rags looked awfully flammable…</sup></p>
<p>The corridor turned into a ramp, which turned left and left again, each leg slightly shorter than the one before. Just as Finner realized they were climbing the inside of the pyramid they reached their destination. “Voila,” the mummy rasped, waving them forward proudly.</p>
<p>To call the chamber they entered a “room” would have been like calling the pyramid “large”. If Gran-Granna Tumbly’s house had been tucked into one corner there would still have been plenty of room for a hockey rink and a river barge. And while there wasn’t a hockey rink, there <em>was</em> a river barge and something that looked suspiciously like Gran-Granna’s living room, along with dozens of statues, a chariot, six life-sized wooden horses, a small catapult, and a workbench covered with tools, bits of wood, rolls of fabric, and a stack of magazines.</p>
<p>“Please… sit down…” the mummy told them, gesturing at a matched pair of blue-and-gold striped couches. “I know… it’s not… much… to look at… but…”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s amazing,” the small santa said when the mummy’s pause stretched longer than usual. “And I <em>love</em> what you’ve done with the side tables.”</p>
<p>“I… refinished those… myself,” the mummy said proudly. “Here… let me… show you… the originals.” It pulled a magazine out of the pile on the workbench and flipped through it, muttering under its lack of breath. “There! What do… you think?”</p>
<p>It thrust the magazine at the small santa while the burly one plopped himself down on the nearest couch, which creaked slightly under his weight. Finner sat hesitantly on the other as the lean santa said appreciative things about stains and lacquers and agreed that of <em>course</em> you had to see it in the room to really appreciate it, particularly with such difficult lighting.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Finner finally said, after trying and filing twice to screw up enough courage to speak. “But can someone please tell me what’s going on? And, um, how I can get home from here? Because I’d like to. And because I’m worried about Gran-Granna,” they added hastily.</p>
<p>“You can’t get there from here,” the small santa said, setting aside the filigree tea tray that the mummy had casually mentioned was an antique<sup>By the standards of the living, anyway.</sup> “Emergency chimneys are one-way. But I’m sure Sensei Tumbly is all right,” she added. “She’s a tough old bird.”</p>
<p>“Tough as they come,” the burly santa agreed, nodding. “Why, there was this time—”</p>
<p>“Why do you keep calling her that?” Finner interrupted, angry at the panicky note in their voice. “Sorry, but—where <em>are</em> we? And would you <em>please</em> tell me what’s going on and who you are?”</p>
<p>The three santas exchanged looks. The smaller santa sighed. “I’m Santa Hood. This is Santa Greenwood, and…?”</p>
<p>“Santa Hotep,” the mummy supplied.</p>
<p>“And you’re what, from an alternate universe?” Finner asked. “I’m not stupid,” they added when Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Alternate <em>universes</em>,” she corrected. “We’re each the santa in our world. Most only have one,” she added.</p>
<p>“That sounds kind of lonely,” was all Finner could think to say.</p>
<p>Santa Hood shrugged. “It works out. Some of the science elves think we’re why all those universes exist. Every kind of santa that can be, must be. It’s all very quantum.”</p>
<p>“So what kind of santa are you?” Finner asked.</p>
<p>She grinned wickedly. “I’m the kind that steals presents from the rich and gives them to the poor.”</p>
<p>Finner digested that for a moment. “And you’re the kind that chops down trees and gives everyone firewood as a gift?” they asked Santa Greenwood.</p>
<p>“No,” the burly man growled in the awkward silence that followed. “The gifts are for the trees. The ax is for choppin’ down anyone who tries to hurt ’em.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t… brought anyone… a gift… in years,” Santa Hotep wheezed wistfully as Finner digested that. “After… the oasis… dried up… they all… moved away. It’s peaceful… but… I do miss… the unwrapping… sometimes.”</p>
<p>Santa Hood patted the mummy’s hand. “Well, you’ve certainly kept yourself busy. This place looks <em>amazing</em>.”</p>
<p>“I have… Miz Tumbly… to thank… for that.” The mummy took a faded magazine off a lovely lacquered bookshelf, its pages stiff with age. “She felt… sorry for me… And started… bringing me… these. It was… the nicest thing. I hope… she’s… all right.” It paused. “Or if not,” it added reflectively, “I hope… Someone will… take care… of her… properly. It would… be nice… to have… company.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure Sensei Tumbly is fine,” Santa Hood said firmly. She stood and slung her sack over her shoulder with a wince. “But we should keep moving. Headquarters needs to know about the attack, and we have to find a way to get Findlay here home”</p>
<p>“It’s Finner, actually,” Finner corrected, or would have if an ear-splitting yowl hadn’t interrupted them.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood surged to his feet, his ax in his hands, as Santa Hotep drew a circle with its fingertip on the mirror by its elbow. The mirror’s surface rippled and reformed to show the steps leading up to the pyramid entrance, where the stone cats were fighting a quartet of people in bright red business suits wielding swords and rayguns whose brilliant green beams left glassy scorches on the sand.</p>
<p>“Impossible,” Santa Hotep wheezed angrily. “They can’t—”</p>
<p>“They have,” Santa Hood snapped. “We <em>really</em> need to get out of here.”</p>
<p>Santa Hotep nodded. “This way.” It shambled off, moaning under its breath.<sup>Even though it wasn’t actually breathing.</sup></p>
<p>The chamber was larger than Finner had realized, and there were more statues than— They froze as one of the statues turned its head. “Automated defenses,” Santa Hood said without breaking stride. “Pretty standard in a place like this. I <em>am</em> a thief,” she added over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Santa Hotep led them to a completely unremarkable patch of the wall. “Left… left… right… and ah… whoopsie doo…” it recited as it did a slow shuffling dance. With the slightest of scraping sounds the enormous stone block in front of it pivoted to reveal another passage, smaller and narrower than the one they had climbed but lit by the same flickering torches.</p>
<p>“After… you…” The mummy waved them ahead. Santa Greenwood squeezed through the opening, muttering under his breath.<sup>He <em>was</em> actually breathing—rather noisily, in fact.</sup> Finner followed with Santa Hood on their heels.</p>
<p>Up, up, up they went. The passage cut back on itself so often that Finner began to feel dizzy. They were just about to ask how much further it was when they rounded a final bend and were almost blinded by the bright blue square of empty sky in front of them. That, and the dazzling green beam of a raygun blast.</p>
<p>“Jet packs,” Santa Greenwood spat “Of <em>course</em> they have jet packs.” He leaned to the side and brought his ax up just in time for the next shot to bounce off its shiny blade.</p>
<p>“Where’s the chimney?” Santa Hood demanded as the mummy caught up with them.</p>
<p>“Right… in front… of you…” it wheezed.</p>
<p>“I don’t see anything!” Santa Greenwood shouted, deflecting another shot. And then he bellowed, “AAAAHHH!” because the mummy (who was much stronger than it looked) pushed all three of them out into the empty air where they fell screaming to their deaths.</p>

<h2 id="episode-5-in-which-our-protagonist-is-rescued-at-the-last-moment">Episode 5: In Which Our Protagonist Is Rescued at the Last Moment</h2>
<p>At least, that’s what Finner expected would happen in the heart-stopping second before the universe shifted around them again like one of those “see it both ways” puzzles and the desert became an ocean, a beautiful blue ocean with nice soft waves instead of thump-and-that’s-the-end-of-you dunes.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood made the biggest splash: between his size and hitting the water in a spread-eagle bellyflop, he actually, briefly, left a dent in the water. Finner had only a moment to admire how Santa Hood tucked in her elbows and clutched her sack to her chest so that she plunged into the water as gracefully as a seahawk diving for fish before they discovered the hard way that the water was very, very cold.</p>
<p>They spluttered to the surface, thrashing their arms against the weight of their suddenly-sodden coat. It was heavy, and their boots felt like concrete blocks on their feet. “Help!” they spluttered.</p>
<p>“Periwinkle!” Santa Greenwood roared.</p>
<p>“I’m working on it!” Santa Hood shouted back. She pulled something bright orange out of her sack. With a sharp <em>pop!</em> and a hissing sound it began to inflate.</p>
<p>“Be careful with your stupid ax!” she yelled at Santa Greenwood as she tossed her sack and then her coat into the little dinghy.</p>
<p>“I’m bein’ careful! And it ain’t stupid!” the burly santa yelled back. A dozen powerful one-armed strokes and they dragged themselves up onto the dinghy, nearly flipping it over in the process.</p>
<p>Finner was too busy not drowning to really notice this, though. They’d managed to kick off one boot<sup>Their mother always told them to do up their laces properly so they didn’t trip and break their neck. It had never occurred to them to use, “But what if I fall into another universe and need to kick them off so I don’t drown?” as an excuse not to, but you can. Good luck.</sup> and were struggling to unbutton their coat when Santa Hood popped up beside them like an otter and said, “Easy, easy, let me do that.”</p>
<p>Panting and kicking furiously to stay afloat, Finner squelched their panic long enough for Santa Hood’s deft fingers to undo their buttons and hold the sleeves so that Finner could pull out their arms. The heavy blue coat floated away, taking with it a handkerchief,<sup>Santas don’t blow their noses on tissue paper. That’s for wrapping presents.</sup> a folded piece of paper with a game of Hangman on it left over from a particularly boring school assembly, and a mostly uneaten piece of toffee.</p>
<p>Santa Hood boosted Finner into the dinghy and then pulled herself over the gunwale as well. “Y’aright?” Santa Greenwood asked, wringing water out of his beard. He had a bit of seaweed in his hair, Finner noticed. And there was a ship behind him.</p>
<p>“There’s a ship,” they said, pointing at the black sails climbing slowly above the horizon.</p>
<p>“G-g-good,” Santa Hood said, shivering. “I was afraid this might b-b-be one of those worlds where the ch-ch-chimney connects to a lost city.”</p>
<p>“Heh. You remember Santa Kraken?” Santa Greenwood shook himself like a very large dog and laid his ax across his knees.</p>
<p>Santa Hood forced a smile, her teeth chattering. “Don’t you have something in your sack to keep you warm?” Finner asked, hoping the answers would be “yes” and “I have a spare”.</p>
<p>But Santa Hood shook her head. “Used it a c-couple of chimneys ago.”</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood glared at the ocean as if a billion liters of salt water could be intimidated. “Well, we’d best figure somethin’ out quick or we’re gonna be in some serious trouble.”</p>
<p>Right on cue, a triangular gray fin sliced through the water beside them. “Is there a Santa Shark?” Finner asked weakly, hoping the answers would be “yes” and “it’s actually very friendly”.</p>
<p>Santa Hood shook her head. “I’m af-fraid not,” she said grimly, her teeth still chattering. “Sh-sharks take everything they c-can and never g-give <em>anything</em> back. Be c-careful with that!” she snapped as Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.</p>
<p>“I’m bein’ careful!” Santa Greenwood said, and then three things happened more or less simultaneously:<sup>Whether or not a particular “simultaneous” is “more” or “less” depends in part on who you are. If you’re a helium atom, for example, you can expect to exist for billions of years, so “at the same time” includes pretty much all of human civilization so far.</sup></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A second, larger gray fin appeared in the water beside them;</p></li>
<li><p>the edge of Santa Greenwood’s ax nicked the dinghy’s rubber gunwale; and</p></li>
<li><p>a cannonball whistled over their heads and splashed into the water behind them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A moment later Finner heard a distant <em>crack!</em> like someone snapping a piece of wood over their knee. “Look out!” they shouted instinctively as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>air began feeping<sup>Some worlds have invented words that others would do well to borrow. For example, the <em>eeeee</em> sound that air makes as it escapes from a pinched balloon neck (or a rubber dinghy) is called “feeping” in Finner’s world. Our world’s contribution to this exchange would be “phlegm”, which is another word that sounds exactly like the thing it describes.</sup> out of the dinghy;</p></li>
<li><p>the larger gray fin changed course to head straight for them; and</p></li>
<li><p>a second cannonball whistled overhead, followed by a somewhat less distant <em>crack!</em> as the sound of it being fired caught up it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Santa Greenwood stood up, nearly causing the others to spill over the side as the dinghy rocked dangerously. “Come on, Periwinkle, gimme something!” he roared. “Chili grenades! Tangle muffins! Anything!”</p>
<p>“I’m out!” Santa Hood, her arm deeper in her sack than basic physics should have allowed.<sup>Basic physics was actually quite uncomfortable about this, but nobody thought to ask it. Quantum physics would have just said, “Whatever, dude.”</sup></p>
<p>A ship appeared beneath the sails, a wooden ship painted the same menacing color as the sails. There was an orange flash on her deck. A moment later a third cannonball hit the water between the dinghy and the circling gray fins.</p>
<p>“Ya gormless nabblers!” Santa Greenwood bellowed, shaking his ax at them so hard that he lost his footing. Finner grabbed his belt instinctively to stop him from falling out of the dinghy and was nearly pulled out himself. “Why don’tcha come here an’ try that, eh?”</p>
<p>Another orange flash, another cannonball. The ship was close enough now that Finner could see crew in the rigging and on the deck shouting and waving. “Wait! They’re not shooting at us!” Finner exclaimed. “They’re shooting at the sharks!”</p>
<p>“Or they just can’t aim!” Santa Hood snapped, her arm still deep in her sack.</p>
<p>And then the smaller gray fin decided it was now or never and changed course and raced toward them, the shark beneath it a menacing dark bulk just below the surface. Finner could feel the dinghy softening beneath his bootless foot as Santa Greenwood tried to stand up again and Santa Hood ducked so as not to be beheaded by the ax he really wasn’t being very careful with, actually, and then she said, “Got it!” and pulled something out of her sack and threw it.</p>
<p>There was a loud bang. Sea water splattered all over them. Finner’s eyes immediately began itching and streaming. “One last ch-chili bomb,” Santa Hood said.</p>
<p>“Ahoy!” a distant voice called as the two gray fins turned and fled.<sup>Or rather, decided <em>quite independently of their changed circumstances</em> that it was a good time to pursue other opportunities, because sharks <em>never</em> “flee”.</sup> “Might ye be in need of assistance there?”</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood’s face fell. “Oh, not him,” he muttered. “Anyone but him.”</p>
<p>“Who?” Finner and Santa Hood asked simultaneously. She glanced at Finner and shrugged. “I don’t know <em>everyone</em>,” she said defensively.</p>
<p>The black ship came up beside them. Rope ladders already hung over her side, each with a sailor hanging from it with their arm outstretched. One, two, and <em>three</em> (Santa Greenwood being rather heavy) and the dinghy was left empty in the ship’s wake.<sup>The dinghy rather appreciated having some time to itself, what with the first few minutes of its inflated existence being so full of new experiences. Then it sank, which only goes to show—something.</sup></p>
<p>Finner clambered up the rope ladder and on to the deck. Given recent events, they were completely unsurprised to find themself face-to-face with another santa. But what a santa: between the eyepatch, the skull earrings, the peg leg, the parrot (with a peg leg of her own) and the very large and very sharp cutlass in his hands, <em>this</em> was the kind of santa other santas dreamed of growing up to be.</p>
<p>“Well, ain’t you the lucky ones?” the santa boomed, a twinkle in his eye. “Us happenin’ along just now an’ all. Coulda been mighty dicey there, mighty dicey indeed.”</p>
<p>“We were doin’ all right,” Santa Greenwood muttered sullenly.</p>
<p>“Aye, I could see that,” the pirate santa said, straight-faced. “Ah, but where’s me manners? I’m Cap’n Clausbeard, an’ this is my crew.” He waved his sword to include the dozen figures now standing around and behind the new arrivals, all of whom just happened to have sharp implements or thuddy things<sup>I.e., things that go “thud” when they hit you.</sup> in their hands.</p>
<p>“This is Santa Hood,” Santa Greenwood said reluctantly. “And Figleaf—they’re Miss Tumbly’s.”</p>
<p>“It’s Finner,” Finner corrected automatically, No-one noticed.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood sighed heavily and gestured at Captain Clausbeard. “And this—this is my dad.”</p>
