The rest of the day passed in the meandering way that drizzly days often do.
Maddy and Sindy helped their mother wash clothes in the big tub on the back porch.
They peeled and boiled potatoes,
mended a torn sleeve,
and played two games of checkers.

"Tell me a story about Papa,"
Sindy begged as Mama Roo tucked her in.
"Tell me the one about the time you two went dancing."

Maddy sat quietly on the stairs out of sight to listen
as her mother told the story.
She was old enough now to notice how the details sometimes changed,
but that didn't matter.
"And then he said, not with feet like these,"
she mouthed silently
in time with her mother
at the story's end.
There was a moment of quiet murmuring
and the sound of Mama Roo kissing her youngest daughter's forehead.
Maddy wiped her eyes and slipped quietly downstairs
to do some more sketching at the kitchen table.
The tiger would have a fierce scowl, she thought.
The rabbit would be winking, and the bear—she wasn't sure about the bear yet,
but maybe she could rest her elbow on the mulebot's back
and looking a little puzzled
like Zeke did when someone used too many big words.

A nudge against Maddy's ankle woke her.
She had fallen asleep with her head on her arms,
a pencil still in her hand.
She yawned,
then jumped at another nudge.

"Wuzza?"
She looked under the table,
not entirely sure if she was awake or dreaming.
"Oh hey, Mouse.
You're right,
I should be in bed."

But when she stood up and turned toward the stairs
the little maintenance bot scooted in front of her.
She tried to step around it,
but it rolled back in her way again.

"Hey,
Mouse,
come on.
It's too late to play fetch,"
she grouched.

Lights flashed on the bot's back.
Its single arm pointed toward the hallway.
"What?
No,
I'm not going outside.
It's the middle of the night!"

The bot zipped back and forth a couple of times,
still pointing at the front door.
Maddy yawned again.
"Fine, I'll have a look.
But then I'm going to bed, aright?"

The dirt road outside the Roos' front door was empty
and as quiet as the stars overhead.
A chuckwill sang a two-note song somewhere in the distance,
pausing after every second note as if waiting for applause.
Maddy shivered.
The night wasn't cold,
but the air was damp.

"There, I looked, aright?"
She looked down at the little bot in exasperation.

And froze as a second bot crept out from under
the battered wicker chair that stood beside the front door.
"Hello,"
she said uncertainly.
It waggled one of its six legs at her,
then shuffled to the side to make room for another hexabot,
larger and with a heavy wrench claw in place of one of its legs.

Something clunked on the steps behind her.
She turned cautiously.
The long-legged gardening bot that Sindy called the Stork dipped its head.

Mouse nudged her ankle again,
blinked its lights,
and pointed toward the steps.
"What?
Oh no,
not in the middle of the night."

The little bot bumped her ankle again more insistently.
"No!
Mouse,
mama would have me doing extra chores for a month if I went wandering off at this hour."
Bump.
"No!"

"Pleezz."
The buzzing voice seemed to come from all of the bots at once.
The gardening bot nudged her hand with its might-as-well-call-it-a-head.
"Pleezz."

She hesitated a moment longer,
then nodded.
"Aright.
But if anything weird happens,
I'm headin' straight back here."

The world is different at night.
Even the most familiar things seem new and strange when no one else is around.
A tree she had climbed practically every day when she was Sindy's age
looked like a silver sketch of itself
as the moon broke through the clouds.
The tall grass waving gently in the breeze by the side of the road
looked like waves on the ocean,
or at least like what she had always imagined waves looked like.

The quartet of bots led her off the road
to a small clearing where a dozen other bots waited patiently among the shadows.
Some she recognized from Dockety's camp,
but others were new to her.

"Hello," she said uncertainly when her guides paused.

"Hello, Miz Roo," the bots replied in unison—or no,
not in unison but in turn.
They buzzed, warbled, clicked, and hummed in rapid succession
to create the illusion of a single voice
that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.
"Thank you for coming.
It is a pleasure to meet you."

Maddy gulped.
"Pleased to meet you too, um…?"

"We are the Gears,"
the bots said.
"We are the little machines that no one notices,
the odds and ends that keep the world in repair.
We are many,
but we are one."

"Um, aright."
A thought struck her.
"So is Mouse always part of you?
Like,
when I'm talking to it,
am I talking to all of you too?"

"When we are many, we are many."
The bots paused.
"And when we are one, we are one."
Which Maddy thought was as clear as mud,
but the bots were still speaking.
"You helped free some parts of us
and have made others of us welcome.
We wish to thank you."

"You're welcome," she said automatically.
"It was—"

But the Gears wasn't finished speaking.
"Your father is with other prisoners in Central."
The bots paused.
"We calculated that you would desire this information.
We hope we calculated correctly."

"…what?"
Maddy managed.

"We calculated that you would desire this information.
We hope we calculated correctly,"
the bots repeated.

Maddy swallowed,
her mouth suddenly dry.
Was this just a dream?
"How—how do you know?
And where is he?
*How* is he?"

The storkbot clacked its shears.
The other bots twitched, wriggled, or blinked in turn
so that a wave ran through them.
"Central is holding him in one of its operational centers—the place you call Heck.
Other parts of us are captive there as well.
We can only communicate when—"
They paused.
"You do not have the words.
The Makers placed little moons above the world.
We can only communicate with our other parts when they are in the right positions.
We receive glimpses of your father and others then."

Maddy shook her head.
She didn't understand the part about "little moons",
but that didn't matter.
"Is he aright?
Please,
tell me,
is he aright?"

The Gears paused again as if searching for the right word.
"He is functional, but not optimal.
The facility was not designed to sustain organics."

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Are you sure it's him?"

One of the hexabots scuttled forward,
pulled a scrap of paper out of the wire basket attached to its underside,
and offered it to Maddy.
She unfolded it and bit her lip.
It was a sketch of her and her sister—just their faces,
but she'd recognize her father's wide-eyed style anywhere.

She steadied herself.
"Can you get him out?"

The lights on Mouse's back blinked.
"Not without help," the Gears said.
"We are many, but we are small.
We need help.
We need your sister's help."

"What?"
Maddy shook her head.
"Sindy's just a kid.
She's not going anywhere near Heck!"

The Gears' component bots rustled.
"There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people.
This is why we need your sister."
The storkbot clacked its shears again for emphasis.

"But—"
*But she almost didn't make it back the last time,*
Maddy thought.
*And neither did I, and Gumption almost died.*

A sudden thought struck her.
"What about the Regulators?" she asked excitedly.
"They know all about sneaking into places and fighting bots and what-not!
I can bring 'em out here to meet you and—"

"No!"
The Gears' voice was sharp.
"Not them.
Not anyone,
but especially not them.
They hunt our kind.
They disconnect us.
They disassemble us.
You must not tell them we are here."
Mouse rolled back and forth in agitation.

Maddy swallowed,
suddenly reminded that it was the middle of the night
and no one knew where she was.
"I gotta think about this," she hedged.
"If I want to talk to you again,
do I just ask Mouse?"

There was a moment of silence.
"What is 'mouse'?" the Gears asked suspiciously.

Maddy pointed at the little cleaning bot.
"That one.
I didn't know its real name, so I called it Mouse."

The storkbot clacked its shears.
"Its designation is Beta-Loopy Nine Six Six Four Rev Two,"
the Gears said.
Mouse blinked.
"But you may continue to call it Mouse."

"Aright,"
Maddy said.
"I have to think about this."

"Think quickly,"
the Gears warned.
"Central moves its prisoners from station to station.
If your father is relocated,
we may not be able to reach him."

Maddy nodded.
"Come on," she said to Mouse.
"Let's go home."
