## Mail (Maddy)

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the main square of the village
when one of the Ox brothers hollered,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were in the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn't capture
the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now she knew he might still be alive.

"Waitin' on anythin' in particular?"
a familiar voice drawled behind her.

Maddy jumped, startled.
Mayor Lupus smiled down from the porch behind her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of teeth.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and—"

"—and it's a beautiful sunny day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're getting a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
Mayor Lupus had a way of looking at people
that made them feel like she could read their minds.
That was a big part of why the village kept re-electing her:
almost everyone who might have run against
her felt guilty just thinking about it.

A double handful of people gathered
to share small talk as they waited for the mail.
Zeke Bear had finally finished fixing the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the bot attack a few months ago.
He might not be happy that the bots who had helped save them were building homes nearby,
but even he would admit they were useful.
The apple orchard was draining properly for the first time in forever,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in town.

"Maybe,
but taking charity from a bot still makes me uncomfortable,"
Miz Tumbly sighed loudly,
shaking her graying mane.

Mayor Lupus tipped the dregs of her tea into the planter by her elbow.
"I reckon lettin' 'em settle in beside us is payment enough,"
she said conversationally.
"Between that and gettin' first look at whatever salvage comes down the river,
they have a lot more than they used to.
And if any trouble shows up, well…"
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fightin' bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Miz Tumbly's whiskers twitched slightly under the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before,
but had garnered even fewer votes than the mayor's previous challenger.
"A lot of folks think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
"But if she's the change, they'd rather wait."

"Anyway, there it is, right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many of the refugee bots it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made a blue hat with a little tin badge for it,
and Maddy thought it might just be the happiest bot in the world.

Able bumped across the cobblestones and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all," it said jauntily,
replacing its hat and reaching around to open a hatch in its side.
"Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope cameras swivelled one way and another as it began handing out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked back his fur again like some of the older goats.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption—she stifled a sigh.
It had taken him months to heal after the attack.
Once he was back on his feet he'd started using the punching bag
in the yard beside the village school
and doing militia drills with an old pike.
She had hoped this would be the summer they went blackberry picking together,
just the two of them,
but "together" seemed to be the last thing on his mind.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "No," when Able called her name.
She traded a glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope.
"Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge" was written in strong square letters on its front.

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Well? You going to open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin' magic tricks again?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily.
Special Leaf was adamant that they keep her sister's special abilities secret.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey—look!"

"What in tarnation?" Mayor Lupus exclaimed.
A murmur ran through the crowd
as two bots entered the square with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it strode toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on heavy treads,
and in between—

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Miz Tumbly gasped,
her ears folding down in shock.

"Quiet down," Mayor Lupus said sharply.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane clicking on the cobblestones.

"Morning," she said.
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you have somethin' for us too."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures be applied to deter further attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
Were you stealin'?"

"We wasn't!"
Bluster said vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they've been hidin' stuff from everyone,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"I said quiet down!" Mayor Lupus snapped as people began muttering.
"That's a pretty serious accusation, Bluster Goat.
You best be sure of your ground."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile of stuff laid out in a shed."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a zap gun an' saw blades and all sorts."

"Dockety?
Any o' that true?"
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
her ears had flattened too.

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"These possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged,
gesturing at Crusher.
"This one has been using them to clear brush."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational," Dockety said.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*," Miz Tumbly said just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus scowled.
"Would have been neighborly of you to let us know you had that."

"Noted," Dockety said.
"These will do so in future."

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning to the goat twins.
"It's not your business to be poking around like that.
No,
don't interrupt me,
that's just going to make me cranky.
You're both on ditch duty for the next month,
an' if you do somethin' lump stupid like this again
you'll be lookin' back on ditches like they were apple pie.
You got that?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when Bravo kicked the side of his leg.
"Yes'm," they said sullenly.

"All right, then."
Mayor Lupus nodded at Dockety.

"Let's get out of here," Blsuter snapped at his brother
once Dockety untied them.
They stalked off side by side,
their boots clomping on the cobblestones.

"Those boys make me *so* mad!"
Maddy grouched to Gumption as Dockety and Crusher left as well.
"They'd be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren't for Dockety."

"I guess,"
Gumption said noncommittally,
scuffing his boot on the cobblestones.

"You don't think so?"
Maddy demanded hotly.

"I didn't say that!"
Gumption protested.
"But—Miz Tumbly was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all saying that
we don't really know much about them.
I'm not not saying I agree,"
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy's outrage.
"But she said—Miz Tumbly, I mean—that they call us 'breathers'."

"Well, we call 'em a lot worse than that,"
Maddy snapped.

Gumption threw up his hands.
"I don't!
I like having 'em here, you know that.
I'm just saying a lot of folks aren't as quick with change as you."

Whatever Maddy might have said next was cut off
by a familiar pair of voices.
"Regulators! The Regulators are here!"

## The Regulators (Gumption)

"What now?"
Mayor Lupus asked,
exasperated,
as Bluster and Bravo ran back into the square.

The twins bent over and put their elbows on his knees to catch their breath.
"There's Regulators comin',"
Bravo panted,
straightening up.
"We saw 'em just past the school."

Even as Bravo spoke,
Gumption saw four travelers come around the corner into the square.
Each looked more dangerous than the one before.
The rabbit had a long rifle on her shoulder
and a slouch hat pulled down over her ears.
The armor on the six-legged mulebot beside her put Special Leaf's shell to shame.
Behind them was a tiger with a black patch over one eye and a sword slung on his hip.
A bear carrying almost as much gear as the mulebot brought up the rear.
She wore the same dark green jacket with black collar and cuffs
as the rabbit and tiger,
while the mulebot was painted in matching camouflage.

When they were ten steps away from the steps of the mayor's house
the tiger whistled,
short and sharp.
The Regulators took two more steps each and halted in perfect time.
A low murmur ran through the townspeople.

"Nice," Gumption muttered admiringly.

"Hush," Maddy snapped back.

*Hush yourself,*
Gumption thought but, for the hundredth time, didn't say.

"Mornin'," Mayor Lupus said,
inclining her head.
"And welcome to Rusty Bridge.
If I'd known you were comin' I'd have put on some tea."

"My apologies on that, Mayor Lupus,"
the tiger replied cordially,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
"Too many places to be and too few of us to be in them all.
You know how it is."

"No apologies needed."
She flicked an ear.
"But you do have me at a disadvantage."

"Special Blazes at your service,"
the tiger replied,
doffing his hat.

The crowd let out its collective breath.
"I *knew* it," Gumption said under his breath,
ignoring another withering look from Maddy.

Special Blazes was *famous*.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
"The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!"
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half-Heart Pass,
his year-long pursuit of the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption had devoured them all
despite Maddy's disdain for "sensationalism".

"Well,
Special,
it's an honor to have you here,"
Mayor Lupus said.
"Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?"

The elderly tortoise had somehow made his way through the crowd without Gumption noticing.
He was wearing a shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well.
He peered at the Regulators through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed re-shelving.

The rabbit doffed her hat as Special Blazes dipped his head deferentially.
"It's an honor, Special, truly an honor" he rumbled.

"Thank you,"
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
"If you,
um,
well,
as the mayor said,
it's an honor.
If you'd like tea at some point,
you'd be very, um…"
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.

Special Blazes dipped his head again.
"Thank you,
but what we'd like most right now is a chance to wash up."

The mulebot made a grinding noise.
The corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked.
"Or in Bee Six Vee's case,
a bit of oil,"
he amended.
"And miz mayor,
if you can spare a bit of time for conversation,
I'd be grateful for that as well."

Mayor Lupus waved the three flesh-and-blood Regulators inside
while the mulebot followed Zeke around to the back of the house.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
then decided in ones and twos that their chores weren't going to do themselves
and headed for home.

"You ever seen Regulators before?"
Gumption asked Special Leaf.

The old tortoise nodded.
"Not in some years," he said quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.

"Why do you think they're here?"

Special Leaf shook his head.
"I wish I knew.
But please,
be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He is every bit as smart as the stories say,
and the less he knows about Sindy,
the better."

The threesome walked back to Special Leaf's house in silence.
"Done for the day?"
Maddy asked her sister once they were inside,
ruffling the hair on top of Sindy's head.

"Just let me finish this chapter,"
Sindy said without looking up from her book.

"You're welcome to take it with you,"
Special Leaf said gently.
The battle with the bots had added more wrinkles to Special Leaf's green-gray hide,
but his eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses.

"But this is the most exciting part!
Please?"
Sindy pleaded.

Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
"I don't mind."
He was supposed to spend the day weeding his family's vegetable garden.
It wasn't the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father's waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy,
and stooping over would make his mended ribs ache.
On the other hand,
at least Maddy had asked before making a decision.

"Five minutes,"
Maddy told her sister sternly.

Special Leaf nodded toward the kitchen.
The two teenagers followed him into it.
"How's she doing?" Maddy asked
as Gumption plopped himself down in his usual chair,
then winced at a twinge in his ribs.

"Very well,"
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
"I came by this up years ago.
Never knew what it did,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden it was full of pictures.
And not just any pictures,"
he confided.
"They were from the book she was reading.
It was like it read her mind."

"That's great," Gumption said when Maddy didn't respond.
Her sister was one of those rare people with no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for the wiry black tuft on her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but every piece of tech she touched responded to her.

Every time Maddy thought about what that might mean it scared her,
Gumption elbowed her in the ribs to take her mind off it.
"Aren't you going to tell him?"

Special Leaf wrinkled his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
"I was wondering when that would arrive," Special Leaf said.
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddy.

"What's this for?" she asked.

"If it's good news, for celebrating," Special Leaf said.
"And if it's not,
well,
at least you'll have a cookie."

Gumption elbowed her again.
"Just *open* it."

Maddy swallowed,
tore the envelope open,
and unfolded the beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.

"Aw, muck," Gumption said,
patting her awkwardly on the shoulder.
"I'm sorry."

She shook her head.
"No.
No.
They—"
She laughed shakily.
"They said yes.
They're going to publish it.
They're going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!"

She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
"Congratulations," he said as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.

Later that night,
Gumption lay in his narrow cot
and listened to the evening's raindrops drip off on the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
The sound matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
mattered almost as much to her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.

It was great news,
but it also meant she was that much closer
to leaving for somewhere better with people as smart and as talented as she was.
He'd known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf's house
that she would go some day.
He just wished that day wasn't getting closer quite so fast.

He nearly fell out of bed when something rapped softly on his window.
"'Bout time," he muttered,
getting quietly to his feet.
He had oiled the shutter after dinner to prevent it squeaking,
and the nearest branch of the cottonwood was an easy stretch away.

Dockety waited patiently for him at the base of the tree.
"Thank you again for warning this one about your cousins' plan,"
it said without preamble.

"You're welcome."
Gumption hesitated.
"So what did you find out?"

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"He is still alive."

Gumption swallowed hard.
It was what he'd hoped to hear, but—
"Are you sure?"

"No,
but he is the right age, gender, and body shape,
and Central's record of him starts at the right time."
A single drip from its leaves trickled down the bot's head as it spoke.
"It will be difficult to obtain more information.
We can only communicate when—"
Dockety paused.
"You do not have the words.
There are little moons above this world,
placed in the sky by the Makers.
We can only communicate with central records when they are in the right positions,
and trying to send a message would be far too dangerous."

Gumption shook his head.
He didn't understand the part about "little moons",
but that didn't matter.
"Is he aright?"

"He is—"
Dockety paused again as if searching for the right word.
"He is functional, but not optimal.
Heck was not designed to sustain organics.
There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people,
but they usually do not last this long."

A sudden thought struck him.
"What about the Regulators?" he asked excitedly.
"They must know *tons* about sneaking into places like this!
I can bring 'em out here to meet you and—"

"No!"
Dockety's voice was sharp.
"Not them.
They hunt our kind.
They disconnect us.
They disassemble us.
They *destroy* us.
You must not trust them."

"Yeah,
that's basically what Special Leaf said."
Gumption sighed.
"Aright.
Thank you for findin' out."

As he reached for a branch of the cottonwood Dockety asked,
"What are you going to tell Miz Roo?"

"Dunno yet,"
Gumption grunted.
A sharp pain stabbed his side as he pulled himself up into the tree.

## School (Maddy)

"Sorry, Miz Tumbly,"
Maddy said the next morning.
She and Sindy had gotten to school
just as Rusty Bridge's other children were finishing
a ragged rendition of the Plea to the Makers.
Miz Tumbly scolded them more sternly than usual
as they slipped into their usual seats.

The reason quickly became apparent.
"Class,
we have a special treat today.
How many of you know what a Regulator is?"
Every hand shot into the air.
"And how many of you know that
we actually have some Regulators here in Rusty Bridge *right now*?"
Hands strained to reach even higher
as an excited murmur rippled through the room.

"Well,"
Miz Tumbly said indulgently,
"If you all promise to be *very good*,
we have a special treat today.
Everybody find a partner.
No,
Jessamyn,
you can't be your own partner,
just—yes, anyone will do.
All right?
Two by two,
then,
let's go outside for our surprise!"
She sighed as twenty-two children scrambled for the door,
their partners forgotten.

Gumption was the last one through the door.
"Oh wow," he breathed,
then added,
"Sorry,"
when Maddy shot him a look.
There,
in the center of the more-or-less rectangular field behind the school,
stood Special Blazes and the bear who had arrived with him.
Both wore their uniform trousers,
but instead of their jackets they were in plain tunics
no different from a farm hand's.

"Get outta-come on, I wanna see."
Bluster and Bravo shouldered their way through the other children
to stand front and center.

"I missed you in class today,"
Miz Tumbly said curtly.

"Doin' chores,"
Bluster lied without looking at her.
He elbowed his twin.
"Look at the size of 'em!"

The tiger's ear twitched.
Without warning he crouched and roared.
Everyone jumped,
and a few of the smaller children squeaked.

Special Blazes straightened and bared his teeth in a smile.
"Good morning.
Who can tell me what we just learned?"

"That you're really scary!"
Bluster called,
scowling when Bravo made a kissing sound beside him.

"I try,"
Special Blazes said modestly.
"But the real lesson is surprise.
If you're ever in trouble—if you're ever attacked
by bots or anyone else—try to surprise them.
Do something unexpected.
Like this!"

He scooped up a wooden baton from the grass by his feet
and swung it at his companion's head.
Maddy heard it cut the air,
but the bear was faster.
She twisted sideways to avoid the first blow,
ducked to avoid the second,
then threw a punch that would have knocked the tiger halfway across the field
if it had landed.

It didn't.
Instead,
the tiger spun the baton around to knock the blow aside,
then stepped in close and brought his hand up to the bear's throat.
"Aaaand you're dead," he said pleasantly.

Some of the children clapped.
"Oh come now,"
Special Blazes said,
"You can do better than that for my friend Meribeth,
can't you?"

Gumption joined the applause,
but stopped at a sour look from Maddy.
"So here's the second lesson,"
the tiger said.
"Training wins.
Training beats size and speed and everything else you can think of."

"What about tech?"
Bluster asked.

"Even tech,"
Meribeth rasped.
Her voice was as rough as sandpaper on rust.
She took the baton from Special Blazes,
spun it around,
and settled into fighting stance.

The tiger stepped back,
raised his fists,
and winked at the children as his fists burst into flame.
The flurry of punches, kicks, and whirlwind baton strikes that followed
was too fast for Gumption to follow.
Special Blazes threw one fireball after another.
The bear batted them aside,
somehow finding time to strike at her opponent in between.

And then Meribeth threw the baton at Special Blazes' head.
As he ducked,
she reached forward and grabbed the front of his shirt.
"Gotcha," she growled.

Nobody had to prompt the children to applaud this time.
"Woo hoo!" Bluster whooped.
"That was *amazing*!"

Miz Tumbly stepped forward.
"All right, um, thank you,
thank you very much for, um, for that demonstration" she said.
"Now how about we all line up and go *back into the classroom*
and we can ask the Regulators about
all the *other* things they know how to do?"

Gumption and Maddy found themselves in line behind the goat twins.
"We *got* to be Regulators," Bluster told his twin excitedly.
"Did you see how they—blam! blam!"
He threw a couple of punches at the air.

"It was all right,"
Bravo allowed.

"I bet they rehearsed the whole thing,"
Maddy muttered.

"Better than drawin' stupid little pictures,"
Bluster shot back.
Gumption put his hand on Maddy's arm and squeezed to stop her from replying.

The children settled into their seats.
Special Blazes stood at the front of the class
with his hands clasped behind his back.
"Now, who has questions?" Miz Tumbly asked.

Hands shot into the air.
How old had Special Blazes been when he became a Regulator?
Eighteen, but he'd joined a troop of Junior Regulators when he was twelve.
Oh, really?
There wasn't one in Rusty Bridge?
Well, they'd have to fix that, wouldn't they?

Could they see his tech?
Special Blazes looked at Miz Tumbly and tapped his chest.
When she nodded,
he pulled up his shirt.
The children ooh'ed and aah'ed at the glassy lozenge strapped to his chest.
"It lets me make fireballs with my feet too," he said as he pulled down his shirt,
"But they're pretty hard on my boots."

Had he ever killed anyone?
"Bluster!"
Miz Tumbly scolded.

"No, no, it's a fair question," Special Blazes said.
"And unfortunately, the answer is 'yes'.
I never set out to,
but sometimes…"
He shrugged, his face solemn.
"Sometimes you have to choose between one life and many."

"What about bots?"
Maddy asked loudly.

"Miz Roo, I presume?"
the tiger said drily.
"Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"And yours,"
Maddy replied stiffly.
"So if you don't mind me asking…?"

"Too many," the Regulator replied levelly.
"And I hope I've never *decommissioned* any that I didn't have to.
But you of all people should know how dangerous rogue bots can be."
His stern gaze swept the classroom.
"Our job is to keep people safe.
Any bot that respects that has nothing to fear from me or any other Regulator."

There were more questions,
but finally Miz Tumbly said,
"All right, everyone,
that's all the time we have today."
Twenty-two children minus one groaned.
"You all go out and run around for a bit
and we'll do some arithmetic practice after, aright?"
After another round of groans,
these ones more habitual than sincere,
the children stood and headed for the door,
chattering with excitement.

"Miz Roo?
Could stay behind a moment, please?"
Special Blazes turned to the teacher.
"If it's all right,
I'd like a word with her in private."

"Oh—um, of course."
Miz Tumbly glanced sidelong at Maddy.
"I'll be right outside.
Come along, Gumption Goat, 'private' doesn't include you."

Kangaroos and older sisters are both naturally stubborn.
Put the two together,
and you have someone who can wait out a tiger.
After a few moments the corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked up.
"Miz Room,
I want you to know that I would trust Bee Six Vee with my life.
I have in fact done so many times."

"And I trust Dockety and Crusher the same way,"
Maddy retorted sharply.
"My sister would be in Heck right now if they hadn't fought for us.
Makers' Names,
we might *all* be there!"

"I don't think there's any need for that kind of language,"
Special Blazes shot back.
Then he sighed.
"Listen,
Miz Roo,
I know they're your friends,
and I know what you and this town owe them.
But from what Miz Tumbly tells me,
there's more of them every day out at that camp of theirs,
and—"

"Miz Tumbly?"
Maddy interrupted incredulously.
"That's who you been listening to?
Special,
she's as sour as ten-year-old cider!"

The Regulator snorted.
"She is that," he allowed.
"But that doesn't mean she's wrong.
There's been more traffic in and out of Heck since your little adventure
than anyone can remember.
The bots getting busy,
well,
that never goes well for the living.
I'm not asking you to spy on them,"
he continued before Maddy could interrupt again.
"I just think it would be best for everyone if you'd be mindful of what you see and hear."

Gumption was waiting for her
when she hopped angrily out the door a moment later.
"Do you know what he wanted me to do?"
she asked.

"Spy on Dockety an' the others,"
Gumption said.
"I was up in the rafters listenin',"
he added with a non-apologetic shrug.

"They've done nothing wrong!
They've *helped* people!
It's folk like Miz Tumbly that are the problem!"

She half-hoped Gumption would shush her
so she could let out some of her anger.
All the other children crowded around Meribeth Bear and Special Blazes,
pestering them with questions.

"They're all yours,"
Maddy grumbled.
Just as she reached into her satchel for her sketchbook,
a ball of flame shot into the sky.

Miz Tumbly shrieked,
and so did some of the children.
Others when, "Whoa!"
and one even started to clap.

Maddy sprang to her feet.
Special Blazes was crouched low,
teeth bared and claws out.
Meribeth Bear's hand on his shoulder might have been
the only thing stopping him from attacking.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Sindy repeated fearfully,
Special Blazes' lozenge of tech glowing in her hands.

## Departures (Gumption)

Gumption stood in in the Roos' kitchen door
with his hands in his pockets.
He hadn't exactly been invited,
but no one had told him to leave.
He had tried leaning against the doorframe,
but it felt disrespectful next to
the tearful conversation at the kitchen table.

"Everyone was trying it,
and I thought—"
Sindy hiccupped.
"I thought folk would notice more if I *didn't* take a turn,
and then it just—it just—"

Tears rolled down her furless cheeks.
"I didn't *want* to," she sobbed.
"It just kind of woke up."

"Sh sh sh."
Mama Roo put an arm around her daughter's shoulders and pulled her close.
"It's aright.
You didn't do anything wrong."

"But now they're going to take me *away*!"

"Nobody's taking you anywhere,"
Maddy said in a tone that put fireballs to shame.

"But Special Blazes said I had to!
And Miz Tumbly said it too."
She leaned into her mother and sniffled.
"I have to go to and be tested
and they're going to find out about,"
hiccup,
"About *everything*."

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing,"
Gumption ventured.

"I beg your pardon?"
Maddy said icily.

Gumption shrugged.
"My Aunt Dorilee says that if folks are gonna talk about you,
the smart move is to pick something you don't mind 'em talking about.
If Sindy goes for testing and she fizzles,
that'll be the only story anyone remembers."

Maddy snorted.
"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

Gumption leaned against the doorframe,
balling his hands into fists in his pockets.
He was sure he'd had dumber ideas,
but this didn't seem like the time to point that out.

"Maddy, please, be polite,"
Mama Roo chided.
She squeezed Sindy once more and straightened up in her chair.
There were gray hairs in her fur,
Gumption noticed.
When had that happened?

"We don't have make any decisions right now,"
Mama Roo said.
"And we definitely shouldn't decide anything on empty stomachs.
Sindy,
if you'd like to get some carrots—no,
don't make that face.
I know we had them last night—"

"And the night before,"
Sindy muttered.

"—but we'll put some salt and rosemary on them this time
and they'll taste brand new."
Mama Roo stood up,
brisk and confident now that she had something to do.
"Maddy,
can you get a squash out of the pantry?
And Gumption,
you're very welcome to stay if you want."

"Thank you,
but I oughta be gettin' home."
He tousled Sindy's hair.
"You'll be aright."

He wasn't sure if he wanted Maddy to walk part-way with him or not,
but she just said,
"See you tomorrow,"
so he nodded and said,
"See ya,"
and showed himself out.
He really should head home,
but instead he hopped over the split cedar fence
that marked the back of the Roos' yard.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto a dirt path that ran through the trees.
It was muddy from the overnight rain but he didn't slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn't have a name for it.

Nobody in Rusty Bridge knew quite what to call
the home that Dockety and its fellow bots had built themselves.
Was "camp" the right word for buildings with stone floors and proper roofs?
Gumption had overheard people refer to it as "Botsburg" and "Botsville",
but none of those names felt right.
For now,
it was just a place—just a dozen structures ranging in size
from a garden shed to something half the size of the Roos' house
arranged in a circle around a black charging post.

Docker was using a heavy brush to clean the muck out of Crusher's treads when he arrived.
"It says you are better at this than any bot,"
Dockety told Gumption.
"Even better than this one."

"Yeah?
Well, I'm glad I'm good at something."
He took the brush from Dockety and patted Crusher's side.
"Got a right mess of muck in here.
Been clearing brush with Zeke again?"

"Confirmed," the hauler bot flashed on its screen.
The word dissolved into happy sparkles
when Gumption began scrubbing mud and leaves out of its treads.

As he worked,
he told Dockety what had happened to Sindy.
"Young Miz Roo is right," the bot said when he finished.
"Your regulations require her to be assessed.
Her only alternative is to run away,
but the Regulators will be prepared for that."

"Have you ever had a run-in with 'em?"
Gumption asked,
flipping the brush over to pry a rock out of Crusher's treads with its handle.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"This one has not.
With high probability,
if that was not the case,
we would not be having this conversation."

Gumption nodded and went back to brushing.
Sparkles drifted across Crusher's screen with each scrape.
If the hauler bot had been a cat,
Gumption would have said it was purring.

He was almost done by the time Dockety spoke again.
"You could be better at that."

Gumption shrugged.
"Probably,"
he admitted.

"But to be better you would require training,"
Dockety continued.
"There is a school for mechanics in Sandy Bend.
We could make the journey at the same time as the Regulators take Miz Roo for evaluation.
That would be—"
It hesitated.
"Innocuous,"
it finally said.

Gumption straightened up patted Crusher's side.
"That's a good idea,
but I can't afford any kind o' Sandy Bend school."

"It is unlikely that you would be accepted,"
Dockety said neutrally.
"But if that occurred, we would pay your fee."

Gumption shook his head.
"I can't ask you to do that.
Not even for Sindy."

"You do not have to ask."
Dockety hesitated again.
"But you will have to explain the plan to Maddy."
