## The Regulators

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the main square of the village
when one of the Ox brothers hollered,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were in the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn't capture
the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now she knew he might still be alive.

"Waitin' on anythin' in particular?"
a familiar voice drawled behind her.

Maddy jumped, startled.
Mayor Lupus smiled down from the porch behind her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of teeth.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and—"

"—and it's a beautiful sunny day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're getting a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
Mayor Lupus had a way of looking at people
that made them feel like she could read their minds.
That was a big part of why the village kept re-electing her:
almost everyone who might have run against
her felt guilty just thinking about it.

A double handful of people gathered
to share small talk as they waited for the mail.
Zeke Bear had finally finished fixing the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the bot attack a few months ago.
He might not be happy that the bots who had helped save them were building homes nearby,
but even he would admit they were useful.
The apple orchard was draining properly for the first time in forever,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in town.

"Maybe,
but taking charity from a bot still makes me uncomfortable,"
Mama Tumbly sighed loudly.

Mayor Lupus tipped the dregs of her tea into the planter by her elbow.
"I reckon lettin' 'em settle in beside us is payment enough,"
she said conversationally.
"Between that and gettin' first look at whatever salvage comes down the river,
they have a lot more than they used to.
And if any trouble shows up, well…"
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fightin' bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Mama Tumbly's whiskers twitched slightly under the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before,
but had garnered even fewer votes than the mayor's previous challenger.
"A lot of folks think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
"But if she's the change, they'd rather wait."

"Anyway, there it is, right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many of the refugee bots it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made a blue hat with a little tin badge for it,
and Maddy thought it might just be the happiest bot in the world.

Able bumped across the cobblestones and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all," it said jauntily,
replacing its hat and reaching around to open a hatch in its side.
"Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope cameras swivelled one way and another as it began handing out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked back his fur again like some of the older goats.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption—she stifled a sigh.
It had taken him months to heal after the attack.
Once he was back on his feet he'd started using the punching bag
in the yard beside the village school
and doing militia drills with an old pike.
She had hoped this would be the summer they went blackberry picking together,
just the two of them,
but "together" seemed to be the last thing on his mind.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "No," when Able called her name.
She traded a glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope.
"Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge" was written in strong square letters on its front.

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Well? You going to open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin' magic tricks again?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily.
Special Leaf was adamant that they keep her sister's special abilities secret.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey—look!"

"What in tarnation?" Mayor Lupus exclaimed.
A murmur ran through the crowd
as two bots entered the square with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it strode toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on heavy treads,
and in between—

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Mama Tumbly gasped,
her ears folding down in shock.

"Quiet down," Mayor Lupus said sharply.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane clicking on the cobblestones.

"Morning," she said.
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you have somethin' for us too."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures be applied to deter further attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
Were you stealin'?"

"We wasn't!"
Bluster said vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they've been hidin' stuff from everyone,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"I said quiet down!" Mayor Lupus snapped as people began muttering.
"That's a pretty serious accusation, Bluster Goat.
You best be sure of your ground."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile of stuff laid out in a shed."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a zap gun an' saw blades and all sorts."

"Dockety?
Any o' that true?"
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
her ears had flattened too.

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"These possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged,
gesturing at Crusher.
"This one has been using them to clear brush."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational," Dockety said.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*," Mama Tumbly said just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus scowled.
"Would have been neighborly of you to let us know you had that."

"Noted," Dockety said.
"These will do so in future."

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning to the goat twins.
"It's not your business to be poking around like that.
No,
don't interrupt me,
that's just going to make me cranky.
You're both on ditch duty for the next month,
an' if you do somethin' lump stupid like this again
you'll be lookin' back on ditches like they were apple pie.
You got that?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when Bravo kicked the side of his leg.
"Yes'm," they said sullenly.

"All right, then."
Mayor Lupus nodded at Dockety.

"Let's get out of here," Blsuter snapped at his brother
once Dockety untied them.
They stalked off side by side,
their boots clomping on the cobblestones.

"Those boys make me *so* mad!"
Maddy grouched to Gumption as Dockety and Crusher left as well.
"They'd be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren't for Dockety."

"I guess,"
Gumption said noncommittally,
scuffing his boot on the cobblestones.

"You don't think so?"
Maddy demanded hotly.

"I didn't say that!"
Gumption protested.
"But—Mama Tumbly was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all saying that
we don't really know much about them.
I'm not not saying I agree,"
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy's outrage.
"But she said—Mama Tumbly, I mean—that they call us 'breathers'."

"Well, we call 'em a lot worse than that,"
Maddy snapped.

Gumption threw up his hands.
"I don't!
I like having 'em here, you know that.
I'm just saying a lot of folks aren't as quick with change as you."

Whatever Maddy might have said next was cut off
by a familiar pair of voices.
"Regulators! There's Regulators comin'!"

"What now?"
Mayor Lupus asked,
exasperated,
as Bluster and Bravo ran back into the square.

The twins bent over and put their elbows on his knees to catch their breath.
"There's Regulators comin',"
Bravo panted,
straightening up.
"We saw 'em just past the school."

Even as he spoke,
four travelers came around the corner into the square,
each looking more dangerous than the one before.
The rabbit at the front had a long rifle on her shoulder
and a slouch hat pulled down low over her ears.
The six-legged mulebot beside her had a squat turret for a head
and armor that put Special Leaf's shell to shame.
Behind them was a tiger with a black patch over one eye and a sword slung on his hip.
A bear carrying almost as many weapons as the mulebot brought up the rear.
She wore the same dark green jackets with black collars and cuffs
as the rabbit and tiger,
while the mulebot was painted in matching camouflage.

When they were ten steps away from the steps of the mayor's house
the tiger whistled,
short and sharp.
The Regulators took two more steps each and halted in perfect time.
A low murmur ran through the townspeople.

"Mornin'," Mayor Lupus said,
inclining her head.
"And welcome to Rusty Bridge.
If I'd known you were comin' I'd have put on a pot of tea."

"My apologies on that, Mayor Lupus,"
the tiger replied cordially,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
"Too many places to be and too few of us to be in them all.
You know how it is."

"No apologies needed."
She flicked an ear.
"But you do have me at a disadvantage."

"Special Blazes at your service,"
the tiger replied,
doffing his hat.

The crowd let out its collective breath.
"I *told* you," someone said,
just loud enough to be heard.

Maddy swallowed hard,
Special Blazes was *famous*.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
"The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!"
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half-Heart Pass,
his year-long pursuit of the villainous Mattock sisters—she and Gumption had devoured them all.

"Well,
Special,
it's an honor to have you here,"
Mayor Lupus said.
"Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?"

The elderly tortoise had somehow made his way through the crowd without anyone noticing.
He was wearing a shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well.
He peered at the Regulators through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed re-shelving.

Special Blazes dipped his head deferentially.
"It's an honor, Special, truly an honor" he rumbled.
Beside him,
the rabbit doffed her hat and dipped her head as well.

"Thank you,"
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
"If you,
um,
well,
as the mayor said,
it's an honor.
If you'd like tea at some point,
you'd be very, um…"
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.

Special Blazes dipped his head again.
"Thank you,
but what we'd like most right now is a chance to wash up."

The mulebot made a grinding noise.
The corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked.
"Or a wipe down and a bit of oil, if there's any to be had,"
he amended.
"And miz mayor,
if you can spare a bit of time for conversation,
we'd be grateful for that as well."

Mayor Lupus waved the three flesh-and-blood Regulators inside
while the mulebot followed Zeke around to the back of the house.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
then decided in ones and twos that their chores weren't going to do themselves
and headed for home.

"You ever seen a Regulator before?"
Gumption asked Special Leaf.

The Special nodded.
"Not in some years," he said quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.

"Why do you think they're here?"

The old tortoise nodded toward a small group of people still gossiping nearby.
"I think we should have that conversation somewhere private."

## Eavesdropping

The threesome walked back to Special Leaf's house in silence.
"Done for the day?"
Maddy asked her sister once they were inside,
ruffling the hair on top of Sindy's head.

"Just let me finish this chapter,"
Sindy said without looking up from her book.

"You're welcome to take it with you,"
Special Leaf said gently.
The tortoise's eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses,
but the battle with the bots had added more wrinkles to his green-gray hide.

"But this is the most exciting part!
Please?"
Sindy pleaded.

Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
"Five minutes,"
Maddy said sternly.
Special Leaf caught her eye and nodded toward the kitchen.

The two teenagers followed him into the other room.
"How's she doing?" she asked.

"Very well,"
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
"I came by this up years ago.
Never knew what it did,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden it was full of pictures.
And not just any pictures,"
he confided.
"They were from the book she was reading.
It was like it read her mind."

"That's great," Maddy said,
though she wasn't completely sure it was.
Her sister was one of those rare people with no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for the wiry black tuft on her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but every piece of tech she touched responded to her.
Every time Maddy thought about
how the rest of the village would react if they found out about that
she felt queasy.

Gumption elbowed her.
"Aren't you going to tell him?"

Special Leaf wrinkled his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
"I was wondering when that would arrive," Special Leaf said.
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddy.

"What's this for?" she asked.

"If it's good news, for celebrating," Special Leaf said.
"And if it's not,
well,
at least you'll have a cookie."

Gumption elbowed her again.
"Just *open* it."

Maddy swallowed,
tore the envelope open,
and unfolded the beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.

"Aw, muck," Gumption said,
patting her awkwardly on the shoulder.
"I'm sorry."

She shook her head.
"No.
No.
They—"
She laughed shakily.
"They said yes.
They're going to publish it.
They're going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!"

She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
"Congratulations," he said as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.
